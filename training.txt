Text messaging, or texting, is the act of composing and sending electronic messages, typically consisting of alphabetic and numeric characters, between two or more users of mobile devices, desktops/laptops, or other type of compatible computer Text messages may be sent over a cellular network, or may also be sent via an Internet connection The term originally referred to messages sent using the Short Message Service (SMS) It has grown beyond alphanumeric text to include multimedia messages (known as MMS) containing digital images, videos, and sound content, as well as ideograms known as emoji (happy faces, sad faces, and other icons) As of 2017, text messages are used by youth and adults for personal, family, business and social purposes Governmental and non-governmental organizations use text messaging for communication between colleagues In the 2010s, the sending of short informal messages has become an accepted part of many cultures, as happened earlier with emailing [1] This makes texting a quick and easy way to communicate with friends, family and colleagues, including in contexts where a call would be impolite or inappropriate (e g , calling very late at night or when one knows the other person is busy with family or work activities) Like e-mail and voicemail, and unlike calls (in which the caller hopes to speak directly with the recipient), texting does not require the caller and recipient to both be free at the same moment; this permits communication even between busy individuals Text messages can also be used to interact with automated systems, for example, to order products or services from e-commerce websites, or to participate in online contests Advertisers and service providers use direct text marketing to send messages to mobile users about promotions, payment due dates, and other notifications instead of using postal mail, email, or voicemail Looking back on a childhood filled with events and memories, I find it rather difficult to pick one that leaves me with the fabled "warm and fuzzy feelings " As the daughter of an Air Force major, I had the pleasure of traveling across America in many moving trips I have visited the monstrous trees of the Sequoia National Forest, stood on the edge of the Grand Canyon and have jumped on the beds at Caesar's Palace in Lake Tahoe " "The day I picked my dog up from the pound was one of the happiest days of both of our lives I had gone to the pound just a week earlier with the idea that I would just "look" at a puppy Of course, you can no more just look at those squiggling little faces so filled with hope and joy than you can stop the sun from setting in the evening I knew within minutes of walking in the door that I would get a puppy… but it wasn't until I saw him that I knew I had found my puppy Looking for houses was supposed to be a fun and exciting process Unfortunately, none of the ones that we saw seemed to match the specifications that we had established They were too small, too impersonal, too close to the neighbors After days of finding nothing even close, we began to wonder: was there really a perfect house out there for us? Like his twisted feathers, his many scars, the reliable old owl chose the gnarled, weather-beaten, but solid branch often - it being a companion to the wise alone with the night and the last branch to creak in the heaviest wind He often came to survey the fields and the clouds before his hunt, to listen to the steady sound of the stream passing through reeds under the bridge, while combing his feathers for the unwanteds - whatever they might be When entering the door at Lou's, two things are immediately noticeable: the place is rarely empty and seems to consist of a maze of rooms The first room, through the door, is the main part of the restaurant There is another, rarely used, dining room off to the right It was added during the oil well boom of the seventies Through the main dining room is yet another room; it guards the door leading into the kitchen This room contains the most coveted table in the place The highest tribute Lou can bestow on anyone is to allow them access to seats at this table This table is the family table; it is reserved for Lou's, and her daughter Karen's, immediate family and treasured friends Billy Ray's Pawn Shop and Lawn Mower Repair looked like a burial ground for country auction rejects The blazing, red, diesel fuel tanks beamed in front of the station, looking like cheap lipstick against the pallid, wrinkled texture of the parking lot sand The yard, not much larger than the end zone at General G Patton High School on the north end of town, was framed with a rusted metallic hedge of lawn mowers, banana seat bicycles, and corroded oil drums It wasn't a calico frame of rusted parts, but rather an orchestra of unwanted machinery that Billy Ray had arranged into sections The yellow-tanked mowers rested silently at the right of the diesel fuel Once red, now faded orange, mowers stood at attention to the left The oil barrels, jaded and pierced with holes, bellared like chimes when the wind was right The bikes rested sporadically throughout the lot In the middle of it all was the office, a faded, steel roof supported by cheap two-by-fours and zebra paneling Billy Ray was at home, usually, five blocks east of town on Kennel Road This family was a victim of a problem they could have avoided-a problem that, according to Florida park rangers, hundreds of visitors suffer each year "Several times a month," Ranger Rod Torres of O'Leno State Park said, "people get scared and leave the park in the middle of the night " Those people picked the wrong kind of park to visit Not that there was anything wrong with the park: The hikers camped next to them loved the wild isolation of it But it just wasn't the kind of place the couple from New Jersey had in mind when they decided to camp out on this trip through Florida Did you know that 7 out of 10 students have cheated at least once in the past year? Did you know that 50 percent of those students have cheated more than twice? These shocking statistics are from a survey of 9,000 U S high school students Incredibly, teachers may even be encouraging their students to cheat! Last year at a school in Detroit, teachers allegedly provided their students with answers to statewide standard tests Throughout history and through a cross-section of cultures, women have transformed their appearance to conform to a beauty ideal Ancient Chinese aristocrats bound their feet as a show of femininity; American and European women in the 1800s cinched in their waists so tightly, some suffered internal damage; in some African cultures, women continue to wear plates in their lower lips, continually stretching the skin to receive plates of larger size The North American ideal of beauty has continually focused on women's bodies: the tiny waist of the Victorian period, the boyish figure in vogue during the flapper era, and the voluptuous curves that were the measure of beauty between the 1930s and 1950s Current standards emphasize a toned, slender look, one that exudes fitness, youth, and health According to psychologist Eva Szekely, "Having to be attractive at this time means unequivocally having to be thin In North America today, thinness is a precondition for being perceived by others and oneself as healthy " However, this relentless pursuit of thinness is not just an example of women trying to look their best, it is also a struggle for control, acceptance and success Gun control has been a controversial issue for years A vast majority of citizens believe that if gun control is strictly enforced, it would quickly reduce the threat of crime Many innocent people feel they have the right to bear arms for protection, or even for the pleasure of hunting These people are penalized for protecting their lives, or even for enjoying a common, innocent sport To enforce gun control throughout the nation means violating a person's Constitutional rights Although some people feel that the issue of gun control will limit crime, the issue should not exist due to the fact that guns are necessary for self defense against crime, and enforcing gun control is violating a citizen's second amendment right to bear arms Throw out the bottles and boxes of drugs in your house A new theory suggests that medicine could be bad for your health, which should at least come as good news to people who cannot afford to buy expensive medicine However, it is a blow to the medicine industry, and an even bigger blow to our confidence in the progress of science This new theory argues that healing is at our fingertips: we can be healthy by doing Reiki on on a regular basis Online games aren't just a diversion, but a unique way to meet other people As millions of gamers demonstrate, playing online is about friendship and cooperation, not just killing monsters These games are a viable social network because players focus on teamwork, form groups with like-minded people and have romantic relationships with other players Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) feature millions of players interacting in the same environment The games are social in nature as they allow players to band together and complete missions based on a story line, or test their skills by fighting against each other At the start of the game, the user creates a fictional character, and customizes its physical appearance Since many games involve combat, players also outfit their characters with armor and weapons, as well as choose their "profession " Many popular game titles like World of Warcraft and Everquest follow a fantasy theme, so most professions have magical abilities like healing other players or raising undead minions While the process seems simple, players may spend hours agonizing over the perfect look for their character, from their armor color to the type of skills to use in battle Once their character is created, the player is free to explore the vast, digital world and interact with other players; however they must pay on average $15 a month for game content MMOG users are mostly male - usually between the ages of 18-34 - although titles like World of Warcraft have a healthy population of female players as well With millions of players, there are plenty of people to adventure with Discuss why assignment essays are common assessment tasks in undergraduate tertiary coursework, and evaluate the effectiveness of assignments as an avenue for learning (Word limit 500 words – 10% leeway) Please note that the APA referencing style is used in this sample essay Introduction Assignment essays are developed from set questions that give students a period of time to research a topic and produce their answer with references to their sources of information While there are some disadvantages with using assignment essays as an assessment tool, there are sound educational purposes underpinning this practice This essay examines the reasons why assignment essays are beneficial for student learning and considers some of the problems with this method of assessment Body paragraph 1 Assignment essay tasks are set to assist students to develop mastery of their study subject Firstly, assignment tasks enhance understandings about subject matter Yang and Baker (2005) reason that “to master your learning materials and extend your understandings, you need to write about the meanings you gain from your research” (p 1) Secondly, research (Jinx, 2004; Zapper, 2006) clearly demonstrates that students learn the writing conventions of a subject area while they are researching, reading and writing in their discipline This activity helps them to “crack the code” of the discipline (Bloggs, 2003, p 44) Thus, students are learning subject matter and how to write in that disciplinary area by researching and writing assignment essays Body paragraph 2 Using assignment essays for assessment supports student learning better than the traditional examination system It is considered that course-work assignment essays can lessen the extreme stress experienced by some students over ‘sudden-death’ end of semester examinations: If we insist that all students write about everything they have learned in their study courses at the same time and in the same place (e g in examinations), we are not giving all of our students equal opportunities Some students are not daunted by the exam experience while others suffer ‘exam nerves’ and perform at the lowest level of their capabilities (Wonderland University, 2006, p 4) Additionally, Jones et al (2004, pp 36-37) propose that assignment essays can be used to assess student learning mid-course and so provide them with helpful feedback before they are subjected to the exam experience Exams only provide students with a mark rather than specific feedback on their progress Therefore, setting assignment essays for a substantial part of student assessment is a much fairer approach than one-off examination testing Body paragraph 3 As an assessment tool, assignment essays have some disadvantages for lecturers and students It has been found that assignment essays consume a great deal of staff time and money to mark and student time to prepare (Sankey & Liger, 2005, p 192) A consequence of these problems is that feedback to students is frequently delayed, and this is much less useful to students than rapid feedback (p 294) It is partly because of these disadvantages of time and expense that other assessments such as multiple-choice tests and short answer questions have an enduring place in the tertiary learning environment Conclusion To conclude, it seems that assignment essays continue to have a prominent role in tertiary education as an assessment tool This is mainly because they are very effective in developing knowledge and writing skills for subject areas Also, assignment essays can be less stressful than examinations as they allow students to show their understanding of content in less pressured circumstances On the other hand, the time consuming nature of writing and marking essays points to some disadvantages that also need to be considered The weight of evidence, however, supports the writing of assignment essays for student assessment because this approach has such positive and proven effects for improved student learning Lomography is the commercial trademark of Lomographische AG, Austria for products and services catering to lo-fi photographers The name is inspired by the former state-run optics manufacturer LOMO PLC of Saint Petersburg, Russia LOMO PLC created and produced the 35mm LOMO LC-A Compact Automat camera — which became the centerpiece of Lomography’s marketing and sales activities This camera was loosely based upon the Cosina CX-1 and introduced in the early 1980s In 1991, the Austrian founders of Lomography discovered the Lomo LC-A They were “charmed by the unique, colorful, and sometimes blurry” images that the camera produced After a series of international art exhibitions and marketing, Lomography signed an exclusive distribution agreement with LOMO PLC — thereby becoming the sole distributor of all Lomo LC-A cameras outside of the Soviet Union Since the introduction of the original Lomo LC-A, Lomography has produced and marketed various lines of branded analogue cameras Most of these cameras are designed to produce a single photographic effect In 2005, production of the original Lomo LC-A was discontinued Its replacement, the LC-A+, was introduced in Fall 2006 The new camera, made in China rather than Russia, featured the original Russian lens manufactured by LOMO PLC This changed as of mid-2007 with the lens now made in China as well Similar to Eastman Kodak’s concept of the “Kodak moment”, the Lomography website endorses a motto of “Don’t Think, Just Shoot” This motto is accompanied by the Ten Golden Rules of Lomography; guidelines encouraging spontaneity and minimal consideration of formal technique The cameras marketed by Lomography are generally low-fidelity and inexpensively constructed Some cameras make use of multiple lenses and colored flashes, or exhibit optical distortions and light leaks Current models marketed by Lomographische AG include Lomo LC-A, Diana, Holga, Holga 35mm, Actionsampler, Frogeye, Pop-9, Oktomat, Fisheye, Fisheye2, Colorsplash, Colorsplash Flash, F-stop Bang, SuperSampler, Horizon 202, Seagull TLR, and Smena 8M The company also resells dead stock Polaroid cameras and Russian dead stock The Lomographic Society International owns galleries, stores and “showcases” dedicated to the growth, support and public exposure of the art The society is based in Vienna, Austria, where most of its events are organised An example of the society’s cultural events showcasing photographs from the community is the Lomokikuyu competition, which raises money for eye surgeries and vision care in Kenya, in partnership with Viennese vision aid organisation Light for the World The project has since been updated and donations now also go to the International Committee of the Red Cross to help fight the famine in East Africa The organisation also organises the Lomography World Congress, an international conference of practitioners held in varying host cities The website also features a magazine, which provides a photo archive storage for their work Articles monitor trends emerging in the community and offer tips on Aficionados of the hobby can blog their own tutorials to share their discoveries, fostering enthusiasm with the Lomographic art Besides fans who are community members, Lomo Amigos, or friends of Lomography, are often celebrities who enjoy working with Lomography cameras and are invited to contribute to the magazine They include Elijah Wood, Neil Gaiman, and David Arquette The site also celebrates the work of Lomographers with online exhibits and competitions Digital painting is an emerging art form in which traditional painting techniques such as watercolor, oils, impasto, etc are applied using digital tools by means of a computer, a digitizing tablet and stylus, and software Traditional painting is painting with a physical medium as opposed to a more modern style like digital Digital painting differs from other forms of digital art, particularly computer-generated art, in that it does not involve the computer rendering from a model The artist uses painting techniques to create the digital painting directly on the computer All digital painting programs try to mimic the use of physical media through various brushes and paint effects Included in many programs are brushes that are digitally styled to represent the traditional style like oils, acrylics, pastels, charcoal, pen and even media such as airbrushing There are also certain effects unique to each type of digital paint which portraying the realistic effects of say watercolor on a digital ‘watercolor’ painting In most digital painting programs, the user can create their own brush style using a combination of texture and shape This ability is very important in bridging the gap between traditional and digital painting Digital painting thrives mostly in production art It is most widely used in conceptual design for film, television and video games Digital painting software such as Corel Painter, Adobe Photoshop, ArtRage, GIMP, Krita and openCanvas give artists a similar environment to a physical painter: a canvas, painting tools, mixing palettes, and a multitude of color options There are various types of digital painting, including impressionism, realism, and watercolor There are both benefits and drawbacks of digital painting While digital painting allows the artist the ease of working in an organized, mess-free environment, some argue there will always be more control for an artist holding a physical brush in their hand Some artists believe there is something missing from digital painting, such as the character that is unique to every physically made object Many artist post blogs and comment on the various differences between digitally created work and traditionally created artwork The main difference between digital and traditional painting is the non-linear process That is, an artist can often arrange their painting in layers that can be edited independently Also, the ability to undo and redo strokes frees the artist from a linear process But digital painting is limited in how it employs the techniques and study of a traditional painter because of the surface differences and lack of physicality The digital artist has at their disposal several tools not available to the traditional painter Some of these include: a virtual palette consisting of millions of colors, almost any size canvas or media, and the ability to take back mistakes, as well as erasers, pencils, spray cans, brushes, combs, and a variety of 2D and 3D effect tools A graphics tablet allows the artist to work with precise hand movements simulating a real pen and drawing surface Even the traditional surface has changed for digital painting Instead of a canvas or sketchbook, artists would use a mouse or tablet to display strokes that would appear with the touch of a pen to the tablet’s surface, or a click of pen Tablets can be pressure sensitive, allowing the artist to vary the intensity of the chosen media on the screen There are tablets with over two thousand different levels of pressure sensitivity The earliest graphical manipulation program was called Sketchpad Created in 1963 by Ivan Sutherland, a grad student at MIT, Sketchpad allowed the user to manipulate objects on a CRT (cathode ray tube) Sketchpad eventually led to the creation of the Rand Tablet for work on the GRAIL project in 1968, and the very first tablet was created Other early tablets, or digitizers, like the ID (intelligent digitizer) and the BitPad were commercially successful and used in CAD (Computer Aided Design) programs Modern day tablets are the tools of choice by digital painters WACOM is the industry leader in tablets which can range in size from 4” x 6” all the way to 12” x 19” and are less than an inch thick Other brands of graphic tablets are Aiptek, Monoprice, Hanvon, Genius, Adesso, Trust, Manhattan, Vistablet, DigiPro, etc All these graphic tablets have the basic functions of a mouse, so they can be used as a mouse, not only in graphic editors but also as a replacement for a mouse, and they are compatible with practically all Windows and Macintosh software The idea of using a tablet to communicate directions to a computer has been an idea since 1968 when the RAND (Research and Development) company out of Santa Monica, developed the RAND tablet that was used to program Digitizers were popularized in the mid 1970s and early 1980s by the commercial success of the ID (Intelligent Digitizer) and BitPad manufactured by the Summagraphics Corp These digitizers were used as the input device for many high-end CAD (Computer Aided Design) systems as well as bundled with PC’s and PC based CAD software like AutoCAD The first commercial program that allowed users to design, draw, and manipulate object was the program MacPaint This program’s first version was introduced on January 22, 1984 on the Apple Lisa The ability to freehand draw and create graphics with this program made it the top program of its kind during 1984 The earlier versions of the program were called MacSketch and LisaSketch, and the last version of MacPaint was MacPaint 2 0 released in 1998 Much of MacPaint’s universal success was attributed to the release of the first Macintosh computer which was equipped with one other program called MacWrite It was the first personal computer with a graphical user interface and lost much of the bulky size of its predecessor, the Lisa The Macintosh was available at about $2500 and the combination of a smaller design made the computer a hit, exposing the average computer user to the graphical possibilities of the included MacPaint Another early image manipulation program was Adobe Photoshop It was first called Display and was created in 1987 by Thomas Knoll at the University of Michigan as monochrome picture display program With help from his brother John, the program was turned into an image editing program called Imagepro, but later changed to Photoshop The Knolls agreed on a deal with Adobe systems and Apple, and Photoshop 1 0 was released in 1991 for Macintosh Adobe systems had previously release Adobe Illustrator 1 0 in 1986 on the Apple Macintosh These two programs, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator are currently two of the top programs used in the productions of digital paintings Illustrator introduced the uses of Bezier curves which allowed the user to be incredibly detailed in their vector drawings In 1988, Craig Hickman created a paint program called Kid Pix, which made it easier for children to use MacPaint The program was originally created in black in white, and after several revisions was released in color in 1991 Kid Pix was one of the first commercial programs to integrate color and sound in a creative format While the Kid Pix was intentionally created for children, it became a useful tool for introducing adults to the computer as well In recent years there has been a growth in the websites which support painting digitally online Internet resources for this include Sumo Paint and Queeky The user is still drawing digitally with the use of software: often the software is on the server of the website which is being used However with the emergence of html5, some programs now partly use the client’s web browser to handle some of the processing The range of tools and brushes can be more limited than free standing software Speed of response, quality of colour and the ability to save to a file or print are similar in either media Digitally painted images allow the choice of viewing on screen, or simply printed on paper for display Other benefits include It has had a large impact on speed painting Each stroke of the painting process can be captured for later replay and study Tools and resources are easy to access on the internet, so that anyone can learn It makes it easy to learn to paint and to progress to ‘real’ painting Computer art is any art in which computers play a role in production or display of the artwork Such art can be an image, sound, animation, video, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, videogame, web site, algorithm, performance or gallery installation Many traditional disciplines are now integrating digital technologies and, as a result, the lines between traditional works of art and new media works created using computers has been blurred For instance, an artist may combine traditional painting with algorithm art and other digital techniques As a result, defining computer art by its end product can thus be difficult Computer art is by its nature evolutionary since changes in technology and software directly affect what is possible Notable artists in this vein include James Faure Walker, Manfred Mohr, Ronald Davis, Joseph Nechvatal, Matthias Groebel, George Grie, Olga Kisseleva, John Lansdown, Perry Welman, and Jean-Pierre Hébert By the mid-1960s, most individuals involved in the creation of computer art were in fact engineers and scientists because they had access to the only computing resources available at university scientific research labs Many artists tentatively began to explore the emerging computing technology for use as a creative tool In the summer of 1962, Dr A Michael Noll programmed a digital computer at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey to generate visual patterns solely for artistic purposes His later computer-generated patterns simulated paintings by Piet Mondrian and Bridget Riley and become classics Noll also used the patterns to investigate aesthetic preferences in the mid 1960s Computer art dates back to at least 1960, with the invention of the Henry Drawing Machine by Desmond Paul Henry His work was shown at the Reid Gallery in London in 1962, after his machine-generated art won him the privilege of a one-man exhibition In 1963 Joan Shogren of San Jose State University wrote a computer program based on artistic principles, resulting in an early public showing of computer art in San Jose, California on May 6, 1963 The first two exhibitions of computer art were held in 1965- Generative Computergrafik, February 1965, at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart, Germany, and Computer-Generated Pictures, April 1965, at the Howard Wise Gallery in New York The Stuttgart exhibit featured work by Georg Nees; the New York exhibit featured work by Bela Julesz and A Michael Noll Note the names of these expositions, not mentioning the word ‘art’, because these ‘generated pictures’ were not yet seen as such A third exhibition was put up in November 1965 at Galerie Wendelin Niedlich in Stuttgart, Germany, showing works by Frieder Nake and Georg Nees In 1968, the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London hosted one of the most influential early exhibitions of computer art- Cybernetic Serendipity The exhibition included many of whom often regarded as the first true digital artists, Nam June Paik, Frieder Nake, Leslie Mezei, Georg Nees, A Michael Noll, John Whitney, and Charles Csuri One year later, the Computer Arts Society was founded, also in London At the time of the opening of Cybernetic Serendipity, in August 1968, a symposium was held in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, under the title “Computers and visual research” It took up the European artists movement of New Tendencies that had led to three exhibitions (in 1961, 63, and 65) in Zagreb of concrete, kinetic, and constructive art as well as op art and conceptual art New Tendencies changed its name to “Tendencies” and continued with more symposia, exhibitions, a competition, and an international journal (bit international) until 1973 Katherine Nash and Richard Williams published Computer Program for Artists: ART 1 in 1970 Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) designed the first Graphical User Interface (GUI) in the 1970s The first Macintosh computer is released in 1984, since then the GUI became popular Many graphic designers quickly accepted its capacity as a creative tool Formerly, technology restricted output and print results: early machines used pen-and-ink plotters to produce basic hard copy In the 1970s, the dot matrix printer (which was much like a typewriter) was used to reproduce varied fonts and arbitrary graphics The first animations were created by plotting all still frames sequentially on a stack of paper, with motion transfer to 16-mm film for projection During the 1970s and 1980s, dot matrix printers were used to produce most visual output while microfilm plotters were used for most early animation In 1976, the inkjet printer was invented with the increase in use of personal computers The inkjet printer is now the cheapest and most versatile option for everyday digital color output RasterImage Processing (RIP) is typically built into the printer or supplied as a software package for the computer; it is required to achieve the highest quality output Basic inkjet devices do not feature RIP Instead, they rely on graphic software to rasterize images The laser printer, though more expensive than the inkjet, is another affordable output device available today Adobe Systems, founded in 1982, developed the PostScript language and digital fonts, making drawing painting and image manipulation software popular Adobe Illustrator, a vector drawing program based on the Bézier curve introduced in 1987 and Adobe Photoshop, written by brothers Thomas and John Knoll in 1990 were developed for use on MacIntosh computers and compiled for DOS/Windows platforms by 1993 Street art is art, specifically visual art, developed in public spaces — that is, “in the streets” — though the term usually refers to unsanctioned art, as opposed to government sponsored initiatives The term can include traditional graffiti artwork, sculpture, stencil graffiti, sticker art, wheatpasting and street poster art, video projection, art intervention, guerrilla art, flash mobbing and street installations Typically, the term street art or the more specific post-graffiti is used to distinguish contemporary public-space artwork from territorial graffiti, vandalism, and corporate art Artists have challenged art by situating it in non-art contexts ‘Street’ artists do not aspire to change the definition of an artwork, but rather to question the existing environment with its own language They attempt to have their work communicate with everyday people about socially relevant themes in ways that are informed by esthetic values without being imprisoned by them John Fekner defines street art as “all art on the street that’s not graffiti ” Whereas traditional graffiti artists have primarily used free-hand aerosol paints to produce their works, “street art” encompasses many other media and techniques, including: LED art, mosaic tiling, murals, stencil art, sticker art, street installations, wheatpasting, woodblocking, video projection, and yarn bombing Traditional graffiti also has increasingly been adopted as a method for advertising; its trajectory has even in some cases led its artists to work on contract as graphic artists for corporations Nevertheless, street art is a label often adopted by artists who wish to keep their work unaffiliated and strongly political Street artists are those whose work is still largely done without official approval in public areas For these reasons street art is sometimes considered “post-graffiti” and sometimes even “neo-graffiti ” Street art can be found around the world and street artists often travel to other countries foreign to them so they can spread their designs The motivations and objectives that drive street artists are as varied as the artists themselves There is a strong current of activism and subversion in urban art Street art can be a powerful platform for reaching the public, and frequent themes include adbusting, subvertising and other culture jamming, the abolishment of private property and reclaiming the streets Some street artists use “smart vandalism” as a way to raise awareness of social and political issues Other street artists simply see urban space as an untapped format for personal artwork, while others may appreciate the challenges and risks that are associated with installing illicit artwork in public places However the universal theme in most, if not all street art, is that adapting visual artwork into a format which utilizes public space, allows artists who may otherwise feel disenfranchised, to reach a much broader audience than traditional artwork and galleries normally allow Street artists such as Above, Jef Aérosol, Banksy, Borf, Dillon Boy, Mat Benote, BLU, Cartrain, Ces53, Dan Witz, D*Face, Tod Hanson, Invader, Michael Kirby, Neck Face, Ellis Gallagher, Vhils, Os Gemeos, Swoon, Twist, 108 and Sten Lex, have earned international attention for their work and have shown their works in museums or galleries as well as on the street It is also not uncommon for street artists to achieve commercial success (e g , Ash, Shepard Fairey, Ron English, Faile, Mr Brainwash and WK Interact), doing graphics for other companies or starting their own merchandising lines Other pioneers of street art who have completely discontinued street art (e g , Richard Hambleton and members of AVANT) have also successfully pursued their contemporary art careers in galleries and museums In 1981, Washington Project for the Arts held an exhibition entitled Street Works, which included John Fekner, Fab Five Freddy and Lee Quinones working directly on the streets Fekner, a pioneer in urban art, is included in Cedar Lewisohn’s book Street Art: The Graffiti Revolution, which accompanied the 2008 Street Art exhibition at the Tate Modern in England, of which Lewisohn was the curator The 1990 book Soho Walls – Beyond Graffiti by David Robinson documents the paradigm shift in New York from the text-based precedents established by graffiti artists toward art in the streets such as the shadow figures by Richard Hambleton and the group of five young New York artists working collectively under the moniker AVANT In 1993, 20 1-ton statues of a coated human-beast called my inner beast where eracted in different cities all over Europe, in order to provoke the average European into seeing their own inner beast Later in the year Jens Galschiøt was first identified as the artist While practically all large cities in the world, and some of the larger regional towns, host some form of urban art or graffiti, there are a few locations that are considered to harbour forerunners of particular mediums or foster a pioneering street art culture in general Such locations often attract internationally known artists who travel to these locations to exhibit their works The following is a partial list of the most notable locations Bulgaria: Sofia – In the night between the 17th and the 18th of June 2011 the monument of the Soviet Army in Sofia was painted by anonymous street artists The Soviet soldiers depicted in the monument for a few days turned into Superman, Ronald McDonald, Santa Claus and others It was a controversial subject and there were many supporters of the monument staying painted and many against it In the early morning of June 21, 2011 the monument was cleaned Germany: Berlin has attracted attention to international urban artists since the reunification of the city, making it one of Europe’s street art strongholds Bizarre post-communist locations, cheap rents and ramshackle buildings gave rise to a vibrant street art scene Hotspots include Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg, Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain Italy has been very active in street art since the end of the 90’s; some of the most famous street artists include BLU, 108, and Sten Lex France: Paris is also a very active street art scene with artists such as Space Invader, Zevs, Mosko et Associés, Mesnager, Zoo Project It started with the Lettrism and then with a Situationist slogan painted on a wall in Paris The nouveau realist, including Jacques Villeglé, Yves Klein and Arman interact with public space but stay, like Pop Art in a classic studio/gallery relation On 1962, The Rideau de Fer (Iron Curtain) By Christo and Jeanne-Claude is an example of early uncommissioned art The Same year sees the first can spray work by pioneer Gérard Zlotykamien After the “chienlit” (expression coined by General De Gaulle to qualify the May 1968 mini-revolution, Paris, like New-York has major city works but no Factory as important as Warhol’s In the 1970s, the work of Daniel Buren appeared in the

events dedicated to promoting street art Poland: Łódź in September 2011, under the patronage of Mayor Hanna Zdanowska, a permanent city exhibition was financed called Urban Forms Gallery The exhibition included work from some of Poland’s elite street artists as well as some more globally known artists Since the 1990s street art has been prevalent in Poland, which is most likely related to the collapse of communism in 1989 Street art is largely, though not exclusively, inspired by the hip-hop music scene It is mostly accepted by the public, with the authorities occasionally giving licence to artists to decorate public spots Despite this, public property is still illegally targeted in some cases Warsaw and Gdansk are among some of the other Polish cities with a vibrant street

public Atlanta: small but growing street art scene in the Krog Street Tunnel and the 22-mile BeltLine path which circles the inner city along industrial and residential spaces Host of the Living Walls street art conference However, in May 2011 Atlanta established a Graffiti Task Force In October 2011 the police arrested 7 persons that they designated as vandals and some regard as artists However, city officials assert that they have no intention of stifling the street art scene The city selected 29 murals which would not be painted over including those commissioned as part of the BeltLine and works created during the Living Walls conferences But the list did not include the most famous street art space in the city, the Krog Street Tunnel Many street artists and members of the arts

councils Key locations within the city include Brunswick, Carlton, Fitzroy, Northcote, and the city centre including the famous Hosier Lane While a number of the most important reform movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries grew out of efforts to combat the negative effects of industrialization, the main focus of their efforts was not the impact of the Industrial Revolution on the natural environment Although some reformers, such as Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot, were deeply worried about the consequences of economic development on the natural environment, the most influential, most effective reformers were primarily concerned with the impact of the rise of big business on small businesses, industrial workers, and consumers, and with corruption in government that reformers believed resulted from the economic power of large corporations Farmers were upset at what they regarded as arbitrary and excessive railroad rates and abuses such as rebates to big business like Standard Oil These farmers were among the first and most outspoken advocates of reform in the late 19th century Pressure from the Farmers’ Alliances convinced Congress to pass and President Cleveland to sign the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, a piece of legislation designed to regulate railroad rates and prohibit corrupt practices such as rebates By 1890, these Farmers’ Alliances had entered politics in a number of Southern and Midwestern states and succeeded in pressuring Congress to pass the Sherman Antitrust Act, outlawing all “combinations in restraint of trade ” By 1892, a national People’s Party had been organized, nominating a third-party presidential candidate and electing several members of Congress The Populist movement, a reform movement attempting to combat the negative effects of industrialization and the rise of big business, was now in full swing Beginning at the state level and with strong support in many urban areas, a new progressive movement reached the national level during the first years of the 20th century Supported by President Theodore Roosevelt, progressive reformers, like the Populists, sought to strengthen railroad regulation and both enforce and further strengthen the antitrust laws In 1902, President Roosevelt not only forced mine owners to submit to arbitration to settle a nationwide coal strike, he also asked his attorney general to file an antitrust suit against the Northern Securities Company, a large railroad holding company After the Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision to break up the Northern Securities Company in 1904, Roosevelt went on to strengthen the Interstate Commerce Commission’s ability to regulate railroad rates by pushing the Hepburn Act through Congress in 1906 A few years later, another progressive reformer, Woodrow Wilson, succeeded to the presidency, and he managed to further strengthen the antitrust laws by pushing the Clayton Antitrust Act through Congress in 1914 While railroad regulation and antitrust actions attracted the most attention of reformers during the period 1880–1920, some efforts were made by reformers to mitigate the effects of industrialization and commercial expansion on the natural environment President Roosevelt used his executive authority to put thousands of acres of public lands aside for national parks, saving them from commercial exploitation In 1908, he convened a conservation conference at the White House in an effort to further mitigate the damage that mining and manufacturing were doing to the natural environment, especially in the West President Roosevelt also pushed for the establishment of the forest service and appointed a conservation-minded ally, Gifford Pinchot, to head that agency Finally, even after retiring from office, Roosevelt supported Pinchot in his efforts to prevent President Taft’s secretary of the interior, Richard Ballinger, from opening additional public lands to commercial exploitation Thus, both the populist and progressive movements sought to combat the negative effects of industrialization and economic expansion by focusing primarily on railroad regulation and the strengthening and enforcement of antitrust legislation Nevertheless, some progressive reformers like Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot did pay significant attention to preventing further damage to the natural environment and helped to found the modern conservation movement Both the so-called “Market Revolution” and the most influential reform movements of the period 1815–1860 took place throughout the United States, not just in New England, and at least some leading merchants and industrialists were enthusiastic supporters of reform It is true that New England was home to a substantial number of reformers, especially several important leaders of the abolitionist movement, such as William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips It is also true that the two most influential reform movements, the temperance and abolitionist movements, were not primarily concerned with the effects of the Market Revolution Yet the spread of the Market Revolution did significantly increase the number of employers who supported the temperance movement, if for no other reason than to try to ensure that their employees came to work sober and ready to do their jobs Although there were numerous reform movements founded during the period 1815– 1860, from the New York Female Moral Reform Society to the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association to the Woman’s suffrage movement, the two largest and most influential reform movements were the temperance movement, initiated by the American Temperance Society, and the abolitionist movement, first organized effectively in the American Anti-Slavery Society Both the American Temperance Society and the New England Anti-Slavery Society, the precursor of the American Anti-Slavery Society, began in New England The American Anti-Slavery Society was founded in Philadelphia These organizations quickly spread throughout the country, opening hundreds of local chapters Among the most important, most dedicated leaders of the abolitionist movement were the New York brothers Arthur and Lewis Tappan, wealthy merchants who gave strong financial support to the anti-slavery movement While some reformers such as the Tappan brothers and Robert Owen, the founder of a utopian community at New Lanark, Indiana, were successful merchants and industrialists, a much larger number of prominent reformers, including most of the leaders of the temperance and abolitionist movements, were motivated primarily by their religious beliefs This was certainly true of Reverend Lyman Beecher, one of the founders of the American Temperance Society and a leading abolitionist; Charles Grandison Finney, an evangelist and leading anti-slavery advocate; and Finney’s disciple, Theodore Dwight Weld, a leading abolitionist and husband of prominent female anti-slavery speaker, Angelina Grimke And, of these four famous reformers, only Beecher was a New Englander Thus, although New England was home to a substantial number of reformers during the antebellum period, it was only one of a number of centers of reform Like the so-called Market Revolution, reform movements flourished throughout the nation during these years, and while some merchants and industrialists were leading reformers, the largest number of prominent reformers appear to have been motivated by religious beliefs rather than a desire to combat any of the evils attributed by contemporaries to the Market Revolution This database contains life tables for national populations and, whenever available, the raw data used in constructing these tables " Data is provided for the

For details, see the Data Acquisition and Access Program guide Abstract: Recent developments in high-throughput technologies have accelerated the accumulation of massive amounts of omics data from multiple sources: genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, etc Traditionally, data from each source (e g , genome) is analyzed in isolation using statistical and machine learning (ML) methods Integrative analysis of multi-omics and clinical data is key to new biomedical discoveries and advancements in precision medicine However, data integration poses new computational challenges as well as exacerbates the ones associated with single-omics studies Specialized computational approaches are required to effectively and efficiently perform integrative analysis of biomedical data acquired from diverse modalities In this review, we discuss state-of-the-art ML-based approaches for tackling five specific computational challenges associated with integrative analysis: curse of dimensionality, data heterogeneity, missing data, class imbalance and scalability issues Keywords: machine learning; multi-omics; data integration; curse of dimensionality; heterogeneous data; missing data; class imbalance; scalability 1 Introduction Technological advancements in high-throughput cell biology have enabled researchers to examine the landscape of biomolecules (i e , DNA, RNA, proteins, metabolites, etc ) associated with a phenotype of interest Next-generation sequencing technologies [1,2,3] have revolutionized the profiling of DNA and messenger RNA (mRNA), allowing genomes and transcriptomes to be sequenced quickly and economically Mass spectrometry [4,5] allows us to efficiently identify and quantify proteins, metabolites and lipids in cells, capturing underlying cellular variations in response to physiological and pathological changes Consequently, large-scale studies on the genome, the transcriptome, the proteome, the metabolome, the lipidome, etc have created a plethora of data associated with these “-omes” also known as “omics” data In this regard, machine learning (ML) algorithms [6,7,8,9,10] have been developed to elucidate complex cellular mechanisms, identify molecular signatures, and predict clinical outcomes from large biomedical datasets [11,12] Traditionally, ML-based single-omics analyses provide assorted perspectives on cellular processes with respect to a particular -ome [13,14,15,16] However, isolated omics studies frequently fall short when identifying the cause of multifaceted diseases such as cancer [17], cardiac diseases [18], diabetes [19], etc This evidence suggests that an inclusive view of cellular processes, constructed by integrating information within and across -omes, is required to provide a comprehensive picture of the biological mechanisms [20] ML-empowered integrative analysis has emerged as a key player in studies involving multiple omics data [21,22,23,24,25] By analyzing different omics layers together, ML-based integrative methods provide a holistic view of biological processes, offer new mechanistic insights on the phenotype of interest, and facilitate the advancements in precision medicine [26] For example, Hoadley et al employed ML-based integrative clustering in a comprehensive study of twelve different types of cancer which resulted in a new molecular taxonomy of diverse tumor types [21] They integrated genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data utilizing cluster-of-cluster-assignments (COCA) to obtain clinically relevant sub-types In [22], canonical correlation analysis (CCA) with dimensionality reduction was employed for jointly analyzing microRNA (miRNA) and gene expression data This analysis provided insight into the mechanisms of head and neck squamous cell cancer and its response to treatment via cetuximab In another study, Arelaguet et al [23] performed integrative analysis of somatic mutations, RNA expression, and DNA methylation data associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) This study identified new factors predictive of clinical outcome by employing a latent variable modeling approach To identify markers of body fat mass changes in obesity [24], proteomics and metabolomics data were integrated to create a “transomic” dataset whose individual features went through z-score transformation prior to independent component analysis (ICA) It was noted that a combined transomics dataset better discriminates lean and obese subjects as compared to single-omics data For improving drug sensitivity in breast cancer, genomics, epigenomics, and proteomics, data were integrated using a multiview multiple kernel learning (MKL) approach [25] This study showed that the predictive performance achieved by multiview learning was found to be better than that obtained by any individual view, where a ‘view’ describes a particular representation of the input data Integrative analysis of biomedical data with ML can be performed in a variety of ways For example, the simplest approach is to construct a large feature matrix by directly concatenating features from different datasets [27] Each feature may go through z-transformation for standardization across all biological samples, followed by ML-based feature selection for molecular signature extraction and biomarker identification Another common integrative analysis approach is to transform data from heterogenous sources into joint latent profiles Latent (hidden) profiles are the transformations of data that can capture hidden sources of variation ML-based clustering is then performed in common latent sub-space for the identification of clinically relevant patient sub-groups [28] In addition, there are ML-based frameworks that fuse data as a step toward building a model, e g , multiple kernel learning or network modelling approaches [25,29] Notably, the accumulation of large biomedical data and the inevitable benefits of studying multiple omics together present new challenges and opportunities for developing novel computational approaches customized for integrative analysis For example, heterogeneous data with mixed variable types, and missing values in one or more omics can substantially hinder the data integration and analysis In addition, when integrating multiple omics data, the dimensions of the dataset can grow into hundreds or thousands of variables, while the number of observations or biological samples remains limited This disparity is called the curse of dimensionality or the p >> n problem, where p is the number of variables and n the number of samples Moreover, the rarity or class imbalance in the data can also lead to results that are biased or less accurate A class imbalance problem arises when rare events are analyzed and compared against events that happen much more frequently, a common occurrence in omics datasets Furthermore, standard integrative frameworks may not be suitable for large-scale multi-omics analysis due to computational and storage limitations Fortunately, advancements in the field of data science are constantly improving the precision of biomedical research, and machine learning is well poised to enable seamless integration of molecular and clinical data In addition, deep learning architectures [30,31,32], which better recognize complex features through representation learning with multiple layers, can facilitate the integrative analysis by effectively addressing the challenges discussed above In this article, we review some of the integrative computational approaches recently proposed for analyzing biomedical data from multiple sources Specifically, we discuss state-of-the-art ML approaches that can address five important challenges in multi-omics integrative analysis: the curse of dimensionality, data heterogeneity, missing data, class imbalance, and scalability issues 2 Curse of Dimensionality In the integrative analysis of multi-omics, the number of variables or features to study is increased, but the number of samples is generally the same, since the measurements from multiple platforms essentially belong to the same biological sample For example, in the stratification of ovarian cancer patients (samples) based on their DNA methylation, miRNA expression and gene expression measurements (variables), the number of variables can be substantially higher than the number of samples (thousands of variables measured on just few hundred patients) [33] This is the so-called curse of dimensionality or the p >> n problem in machine learning [25,34] The increased dimensionality in the number of variables, with the same sample size, makes most ML methods vulnerable to an overfitting problem, i e , highly accurate on training data but poor generalization on unseen test data [33] This is due to that fact that the same samples now cover a much smaller fraction of input feature space [7] The addition of more features may carry new information; however, the benefit of new information can be outweighed by the curse of dimensionality Dimensionality reduction (DR) is commonly employed in omics studies as datasets from genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, medical imaging, and clinical trials are frequently faced with the p >> n problem DR techniques are employed either as feature extraction (FE) or feature selection (FS) [35,36] Feature extraction projects the data from high-dimensional space to lower dimensional space, while feature selection reduces the dimensionality by identifying only a relevant subset of original features [34,35,36] Feature extraction facilitates data visualization, data exploration, latent (hidden) factor profiling, compression, etc Principal component analysis (PCA), a popular FE method, reduces the dimensionality of the data by orthogonally transforming the high-dimensional features to linearly uncorrelated principal comments (PC) Given orthogonality constraints, the top PCs capture maximal variance in the dataset PCA in combination with clustering is an intuitive way for exploratory data analysis (EDA), e g , visualization of sub-groups in a molecular dataset which otherwise are uninterpretable due to high dimensionality Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is another FE method that achieves dimensionality reduction by finding two non-negative matrices whose product approximate the original non-negative matrix Unlike PCA in which decomposition matrices have both positive and negative values, the resulting matrices from NMF only have positive values; thus, original data is represented only by additive combinations of latent variables t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) [37] is an FE algorithm increasingly applied for the visualization of high-dimensional data t-SNE is a nonlinear method and hence performs better when the relationships in the data are not linear The similarity between data points are used to construct joint probability distributions in such a way that the divergence between joint probabilities in low-dimension embedding and original high dimensions is minimal Autoencoder, a building block of many deep learning networks, can also be employed for nonlinear FE by restricting the number of hidden layer nodes to less than the number of original input nodes [38,39] Feature extraction approaches are typically used in unsupervised integrative analysis, i e , when response or group labels are unknown ML-based FE can facilitate the discovery of disease specific sub-groups in multi-omics studies In recent years, many feature extraction methods have been proposed for integrative omics exploratory analysis, with many of them based on PCA [40] For example, multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) was proposed recently as a generalization of PCA to multi-omics data to identify biomarkers in CLL [23] Specifically, somatic mutations, DNA methylation and RNA expression were profiled together with ex vivo drug responses and MOFA disentangled sources of systematic variation (latent factors) arising from disease heterogeneity based on the multi-omics data The latent factors identified by MOFA were shown to be predictive of clinical outcomes Joint and individual variation explained (JIVE) [41], another extension of PCA, was proposed to identify individual and combined variations between miRNA and gene expression data for the same set of 234 Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) tumor samples JIVE is an integrative EDA method that decomposes a dataset into a sum of three terms: two low-rank approximation terms, one for capturing joint structure across data types and other for capturing structure individual to each data, and a term for residual noise In order to integrate protein and gene expression datasets from National Cancer Institute (NCI)-60 cell-lines, the multiple co-inertia analysis (MCIA) [42] employed FE methods like PCA on each data set separately to project them to similar (lower) dimensional space for EDA In MCIA, the diverse sets of variables were transformed to the same scale to easily combine genes and proteins features, providing better biological pathway interpretation Joint NMF [43] and intNMF [44] performed integrated data exploration with gene expression, DNA methylation and miRNA expression data to facilitate the identification of clinically distinct patient sub-groups by utilizing the NMF concept In addition, integrative-NMF (iNMF) [45] was able to identify the heterogenous and homogenous factors across different types of data Non-linear FE techniques including t-SNE and autoencoders also play key roles in multi-omics studies For example, t-SNE was employed to facilitate the visualization and clustering in an integrated multi-omics study of transcriptional and epigenetic states in the human adult brain [46], and the integration of single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species [47] In a precision oncology study of cancer cell lines involving gene expression, copy number, mutation status and drug sensitivity data, the dimensionality of the integrated data was effectively reduced by a deep autoencoder [48] The autoencoder was able to extract cellular state features that were highly predictive of drug sensitivity Moreover, representation learning [49] or the automatic extraction of meaningful representation of raw data (embeddings), which makes predictive models much more accurate, was also considered for integrated analyses [50,51] For example, representation learning was employed to generate node embeddings that consequently produced informative edges in biological knowledge graphs [50] Many life sciences databases make their data available as Linked Data, i e , data having biological entities and their connections standardized with unique identifiers for better interoperability across resources In [50], Linked Data, biomedical ontologies and ontology-based annotations were integrated, facilitating functional prediction and the predictions of protein–protein interaction (PPI), drug target relations, candidate genes of diseases, etc In another study [51], a Multi-view Factorization Autoencoder was proposed for integrating multi-omics data with domain knowledge This deep representation learning method effectively tackled the p >> n problem in datasets, and learned feature embedding and patients embedding simultaneously Filter methods are used to select a subset of relevant features independent of any model Many of the filter methods are univariate and provide statistical test scores for each feature-outcome combination Examples in this category include ANOVA, Pearson’s correlation, information gain (IG), etc In addition, maximal-relevance and minimal-redundancy (mRMR), correlation-based FS (CFS) and ReliefF [56,57] are some advanced filter methods which consider feature combinations For example, mRMR identifies features which are most relevant to the outcome but are not highly correlated among themselves [56] Wrapper methods try to search for the best feature combination by training a particular predictive model repeatedly for various feature subsets and keep aside the best or worst performing subsets Therefore, wrapper methods provide the best performing feature combination on that predictive model Recursive feature elimination (RFE) [58], boruta [59], and jackstraw [60] are popular wrapper methods that repeatedly construct a model (e g , random forest) and remove features with low weights Whereas Boruta selects features with critically large variable importance measures in Random Forest, the jackstraw methods identify statistically significant features with respect to latent variables Wrapper methods can be computationally expensive on a large dataset Embedded methods are in between filter and wrapper methods in terms of computational complexity These are the algorithms with built-in feature selection methods, i e , they perform feature selection as a step toward predictive model building Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is a popular embedded FS method due to its simplicity It is essentially a linear regression method with an L1-penalty (regularization) which shrinks many of the coefficients to zero The features with non-zero coefficients in LASSO are considered relevant variables However, when the features are correlated, LASSO tends to randomly pick only one feature Various modifications are proposed to circumvent this problem, including stability selection [61,62,63] and elastic net [64] Stability selection performs random subsampling and constructs many models on these bootstrap samples Elastic net strikes the balance between L1 and L2-regularized regression penalty terms, with L1-penality preferring a parsimonious model and L2-penality retaining some correlated features such as co-expressed molecules Feature selection is generally employed in supervised ML-based integrative analysis (response or group labels are known) including classification and regression applications In multi-omics studies, FS are commonly employed on each omics dataset prior to integration as datasets are high-dimensional and all the variables in individual datasets may not be informative [65,66,67] This reduction in the number of variables as a pre-processing step attenuates noise prior to integration [67,68,69,70] In [71], supervised feature selection for multi-omics data was proposed for Cox regression analysis that identified more true signature genes in cancer prognosis In [70], an mRMR-based feature selection method was developed to identify epigenetic markers from cancer datasets using gene expression and methylation data The markers identified through this approach were most relevant and least redundant in prostate carcinoma and leukemia datasets mRMR was also employed to identify key features in predicting ovarian cancer grade or patient survival using concatenation of genomic, imaging, and proteomic data [72] In [73], various FS methods including CFS, IG, ReliefF, fast clustering-based feature selection algorithm (FAST) and support vector machine based on RFE (RFE-SVM) were employed to identify features with the highest classification accuracy, in the identification of breast cancer sub-types using protein, gene expression and methylation data Wrapper and embedded FS methods are multivariate, i e , they can extract relationships among different features and hence particularly suited to multi-omics studies RFE is one of the commonly used wrapper FS algorithms in biomedicine [52,53,58,74] and has been recently applied to integrative analysis [33] In [69], mixOmics R package incorporated L1-penalized embedded FS into various supervised omics-integration methods to enable molecular signature extraction In addition, L1-penality based regularization was implemented in unsupervised integrated clustering [28,75], as well as in the integrated predictive modelling framework to allow for genetic feature selection [76] Figure 1 shows the taxonomy of ML-based approaches for dimensionality reduction Genes 10 00087 g001 550 Figure 1 Machine learning (ML) with curse of dimensionality ML-based dimensionality reduction (DR) approaches, for tackling the curse of dimensionality, can be classified into feature extraction (FE) and feature selection (FS) FE methods project data from a high-dimensional space to a lower dimensional space, while FS methods identify a small relevant subset of original features in order to reduce the dimensionality Principal component analysis (PCA), multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA), multiple co-inertia analysis (MCIA), and joint non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) are some examples of FE methods applied in integrative analysis These FE approaches assume linear relationships in the dataset Nonlinear FE methods also exist including t-SNE, autoencoders, representation learning, etc ML-based FS is broadly divided into filter, wrapper and embedded methods Filter methods such as maximal-relevance and minimal-redundancy (mRMR), correlation-based FS (FCS), ReliefF and Information Gain are employed as a pre-processing step before training any model, while wrapper methods such as recursive feature elimination-support vector machine (RFE-SVM) and Boruta incorporate a predictive model to judge the importance of features Embedded methods which include least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Elastic Net, stability selection, etc , perform feature selection as part of the model building process 3 Heterogenous Data One of the biggest challenges in multi-omics integrated analysis is the heterogeneity of data Reasons for such heterogeneity include, but are not limited to, substantially different number of variables, mismatched distributions and scaling, diverse data modalities, i e , continuous signals, discrete counts, intervals, ordered and unordered categorical, pathways, etc For example, Glioblastoma Multiforme is a highly aggressive type of brain cancer whose prognostic prediction can be improved by considering multiple data types together [77], i e , clinical data, gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation, and copy number alterations (CNA) However, integration of these diverse data types in a single predictive model is challenging due to heterogeneities mentioned above In the case of naive data integration, i e , by concatenating features from different data sources, decision trees (DT) may work well with mixture of continuous and categorical variables The decision rules in DT are well interpretable, unlike most nonlinear models which are generally considered black-box In addition, DT has the inherent mechanism of ranking features based on their importance in decision making However, decision trees are known to suffer from the overfitting problem; consequently, an ensemble of DTs or random forest (RF) [78] is preferred over DT Penalized linear models with L1/L2 regularization also minimize the risk of overfitting and perform feature selection Therefore, they are also attractive for feature concatenation-based integrative analysis For example, elastic net [64] was employed for multi-omics analysis in drug–response prediction from the collection cancer cell line encyclopedia (CCLE) [79] encompassing 36 tumor types with diverse variables including gene expression, copy number, mutation values, etc All of these variables were assembled into a matrix and each feature went through z-score transformation across all cell lines As discussed in the previous section, being a penalized linear regression model, elastic net can perform FS-based dimensionality reduction However, the final list of key predictors obtained using this model (and tree-based approaches) can be dominated by the variables from a dataset with the largest number of variables One way to overcome this problem is to perform block-scaling [80], i e , scaling each variable by the inverse of the number of variables in the corresponding data block Moreover, it was pointed out in [81] that the results obtained by elastic net with simultaneous analysis of various molecular data types in drug-response studies (containing both continuous and binary variables) are usually dominated by gene expression data (continuous variables) Consequently, the TANDEM method [81] employed a two-stage FS approach where the first stage uses all the binary variables, referred to as upstream data, and the second stage uses continuous gene expression variables or the downstream data The model selected by TANDEM was more interpretable by preferentially focusing on upstream features while maintaining predictive power comparable to other integrative methods Simple feature concatenation-based integration is not feasible in many scenarios because different heterogeneities may be present in datasets and are not known a priori Multiple kernel learning (MKL) [82] has become a popular approach to integrate data by calculating individual kernel matrices for each data type and fusing them into a global model While kernel matrix encodes similarity between samples, different data sources may have different notions of similarity Therefore, in MKL, data from each source has a separate kernel matrix MKL [77] was successfully applied to GBM prognosis from different data types including, gene expression, CNA, DNA methylation, etc , employing the simpleMKL algorithm [83] Similarly, Speicher et al [84] integrated DNA methylation, gene and miRNA expression profiles using MKL, and later performed unsupervised clustering to discover cancer sub-types Bayesian multitask MKL, the top performing algorithm, introduced as a result of a collaborative effort between the NCI and the dialogue on reverse engineering assessment and methods (DREAM) project [25], was applied to integrate data from different profiling sources including, CNA, DNA methylation, gene expression, reverse phase protein array (RPPA), etc , for predicting drug sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines It employed a Gaussian kernel for real-valued data and the Jaccard similarity coefficient for categorical data The Multitask MKL algorithm integrated different views from different data types by constructing a global similarity matrix as a weighted sum of the view-specific kernel matrices, where kernel weights reflect the relevance of each view Network-based approaches for integrative analysis can also leverage the concept of similarity fusion Similarity network fusion (SNF) framework aggregated mRNA expression, DNA methylation and miRNA expression data for cancer patients, and used networks as a basis for integration [29] SNF fused individual similarity networks obtained from different data sources to obtain single similarity network that captures complementary information It employed scaled exponential similarity kernel in which Euclidean distance was used for continuous variables, chi-squared distance for discrete variables, and agreement-based measure for binary variables Recently, GloNetDRP [85] was proposed, which built a heterogenous network using cell-line similarity networks from omics data of cell lines, and drug similarity network by exploiting chemical similarity between drugs Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) [86] are also a good candidate to integrate mixed data types [87] For example, in a study of long-term body weight change in the general population [88], a multi-omics partial correlation network was constructed by first employing weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) [89] on metabolomics and transcriptomics data separately, and then integrating them using Gaussian graphical model (GGM) [90] PAthway Recognition Algorithm using Data Integration on Genomic Models (PARADIGM) [91], a factor graph-based PGM approach that was proposed to integrate copy number and gene expression with curated pathway information from NCI, provides patient-specific inference of genetic pathway activities PARADIGM inferred cellular activities helped classify patients into clinically relevant sub-groups In [92], sparse graphical models were proposed for accurate group-wise expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping, by capturing the joint effect of a set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a set of genes This approach used two types of hidden variables, one extracted set associations between SNPs and genes, and the other extracted confounders Recently, a Network-based Integration of Multi-omics Data (NetICS) [93] method was proposed to prioritize cancer genes by integrating heterogenous multi-omics data into a directed functional interaction network This interaction network expresses the directionality of the interactions, which is essential as it can explain how aberration events in one gene or miRNA can lead to expression changes of its interaction partners in the network In addition, heterogenous information networks (HINs) [94,95] which capture multi-level interactions in heterogenous datasets can play important roles in integrative analysis of biomedical data For example, HeteroMed [96], extracted latent low dimensional embeddings form EHR data (comprising raw text, numeric, categorical formats) for robust medical diagnosis This method can potentially be extended to the integrative analysis of EHR with other data types Another prominent integrative analysis approach involves transforming data from heterogenous sources to latent sub-space, e g , using PCA or NMF, then performing joint latent analysis or integrative clustering [44,45,97] This approach allows joint modeling, with a combination of distributions, to include different variable types like continuous (Gaussian), binary (Bernoulli) and count (Poisson) [23] An integrative clustering method iCluster [28], based on latent variable modelling, was proposed to identify clinically relevant disease sub-types in latent sub-space from two cancer datasets; breast cancer and lung cancer [28] as well from Glioblastoma dataset [75] Instead of finding clusters of tumor sub-types for each dataset separately and later manually integrating the results, iCluster allowed automated integrated cluster assignment and performed dimensionality reduction simultaneously This was achieved by leveraging the connection between PCA, latent variable modelling and LASSO-type penalty Recently, iCluster was upgraded to iCluster+ to incorporate diverse data modalities including, binary, categorical and continuous values such that somatic mutation, CNA and gene expression were integrated and distinct tumor sub-groups were identified [75] To achieve this iCluster+ assumed different distribution for different data types, e g , Poisson, normal linear, logistic, multilogit, etc Recently, the Scluster method had been shown to outperform iCluster and SNF methods in identifying cancer sub-types by jointly analyzing mRNA expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation data [97] A latent factor-based clustering method referred to as mixed variable restricted Boltzmann machine (MV-RBM) [98] was proposed to aggregate data from highly heterogenous sources including demographics, diagnosis, pathologies and treatments in diabetes mellitus studies With MV-RBM, the datasets were aggregated into latent profiles (homogenous representation), and these profiles facilitated the extraction of patient sub-groups by performing unsupervised affinity propagation (AP) clustering [99] This approach has the potential to be extended to multi-omics integrative analysis Deep learning approaches have been getting attention from biomedical researchers to integrate heterogenous data Specifically, in [100], omics data from multiple sources (gene expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation) were combined with clinical data to perform integrated clustering based on multimodal deep belief networks (DBN) [101] Multimodal DBN is a network of stacked RBMs that seamlessly handles continuous and categorical data, and helps in discovering disease sub-types in cancer patients In addition to integrative clustering, this method can identify signature genes and miRNAs that may play key roles in the pathogenesis of different cancer subtypes In [32], a deep learning-based method was proposed to predict cancer prognosis using CNA, DNA methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data This method is an extension of Clustering and PageRank (CPR) algorithm [102] to address the heterogeneity in multi-omics cancer datasets In [103], three separate deep neural networks (DNN) were trained on gene expression, copy number and clinical data, respectively, for prognosis prediction of human breast cancer Later, score level fusion was performed to get final multimodal deep network Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent type of liver cancer in the U S and to better understand HCC heterogeneity among patients using gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation and clinical information, a deep learning framework was proposed [104] This framework employed an autoencoder to perform nonlinear FE on the heterogenous data, which resulted in the aggregation of genes that share similar pathways Autoencoder transformations led to the discovery of two liver cancer sub-types with significant differences in survival Recently, a Deep Neural Network Synergy model with Autoencoders (AuDNNsynergy) was proposed that integrated multi-omics with chemical structure data to accurately predict drug combinations in cancer therapy [105] This model utilized three autoencoders for gene expression, copy number and mutation data A deep neural network combined the output of three autoencoders with physicochemical properties of drugs, predicting synergy value of given pair-wise drug combination against specific cancer cell lines Figure 2 lists diverse ML-based approaches available for integrative analysis from heterogenous data Genes 10 00087 g002 550 Figure 2 Machine learning with heterogenous data ML algorithms can handle heterogenous data in different ways For naive feature concatenation-based data integration, tree-based methods (e g , decision trees and random forest), and penalized linear models (e g , elastic net and LASSO) can be employed A two-stage elastic net-based approach like TANDEM is useful if data sources with continuous features (e g , gene expression) dominate the data sources with binary features (e g , mutation) Multiple kernel learning (MKL), a robust integrative analysis approach with heterogenous data, employs different kernels or similarity functions for data from different sources and fuses them into a global matrix Bayesian multitask MKL and simpleMKL are notable examples in this category Network fusion methods such as similarity network fusion (SNF) employ similarity network for each data type and fuse heterogenous networks PAthway Recognition Algorithm using Data Integration on Genomic Models (PARADIGM) can incorporate different heterogenous data including gene expression, copy number and curated pathways Network-based Integration of Multi-omics Data (NetICS) integrates multi-omics data on a directed functional interaction network Heterogenous information networks like HetroMed can handle raw text, numeric, and categorical data in electronic health records (EHRs) for medical diagnosis Integrative methods including iCluster+, Scluster and mixed variable restricted Boltzmann machine (MV-RBM) first transform data from heterogenous sources into latent sub-space, and then perform clustering on the latent profiles Deep learning models such as improved Clustering and PageRank (CPR), Deep Neural Network Synergy model with Autoencoders (AuDNNsynergy), multimodal deep belief networks (DBN) and deep neural networks (DNN) have been employed to perform integrative analysis of heterogenous data by learning complex features through data transformations at multiple layers 4 Missing Data Data acquired from high-throughput omics platforms are known to have missing observations due to various reasons, such as low coverage of next-generation sequencing, low sensitivity in protein and peptide detection, and faltered metabolite measurement by tandem mass spectrometry, etc [106,107] The problem of missing data is exacerbated in multi-omics studies as there can be more samples with missing values [108] For example, a CLL study involving simultaneous analysis of DNA methylation, somatic mutation and gene expression measurements against drug response can have up to 40% of the biological samples with some but not all omics data, i e , missing values in 40% of the samples [23] Given that the biological samples are the same, it is statistically plausible to infer missing values in one omics from observed values and in other omics by exploiting any existing correlations found through complete cases Complete case refers to the samples with measurements available on all variables under consideration [106,107,109,110] Generally, most modern missing data methods focus on item non-response case, i e , when data is missing on some variables for some biological samples [106,111,112] Other cases include data missing on all variables for some biological samples, known as unit non-response, and data missing on a variable for all samples, known as latent variable Missing data methods should be able to maximally utilize the available information, properly estimate the uncertainty in missing values and minimize bias [113] Most statistical approaches rely on certain assumptions to tackle the missing data problem [111] Suppose data is missing on variable Y while another variable X is always observed The strongest assumption is that data is missing completely at random (MCAR), meaning that the probability of missingness on Y does not depend on X as well as on Y itself For example, in a clinical study, it may be difficult to obtain a particular test result because the test itself is costly, hence it is only available for 30% of the samples For the remaining 70%, the data is MCAR Note that, if data is MCAR, the complete data subsample is just a random sample from the original target sample The MCAR assumption is required by conventional methods, which is frequently violated in practical applications However, most modern approaches work well with a weaker assumption of data missing at random (MAR) MAR assumes the probability of missingness on Y does not depend on Y, after controlling for the observed variable X, i e , once dependence on X is adjusted, the probability of missingness on Y does not depend on Y itself Again, consider the clinical study example in which cholesterol levels are missing for many subjects and the probability of missingness depends on subject’s sex, i e , females may be less likely to report cholesterol levels than males However, within each gender type, subjects with higher cholesterol levels are neither more nor less likely to report than subjects with lower cholesterol levels We can say that the cholesterol level variable has data missing at random because, after adjusting for subjects’ gender, the missingness of the cholesterol level variable does not depend on whether the cholesterol level is high or not MCAR is a special case of MAR, i e , if data is missing completely at random then they are also missing at random If the data is not missing at random (NMAR) then the missing data mechanism has to be modelled [113,114], i e , simultaneous estimation of the scientific model and missing data mechanism is required The simplest approach to deal with missing data is a complete case analysis also known as listwise deletion Listwise deletion means that the entire sample is excluded from analysis if data is missing on any variable for that sample However, it may result in substantial information loss if the missing data percentage is high In addition to complete case analysis, traditional single imputation methods are also very popular due to their ease of implementation Any approach which estimates or guesses the missing values is called imputation Missing values on a variable can be imputed by replacing it with a mean or median of the variable over all the available samples Imputation based on regression or conditional mean imputation trains any type of regression model for the variable with missing data based on observed values Subsequently, the model is used to generate predicted values for the cases with missing data The k-nearest neighbors approach is also commonly employed for imputation of missing values In multi-omics studies, imputation based on k-nearest neighbors for profiles and genes expression [76], autocorrelation with cubic interpolation for spectral analysis of time series molecular data [115], fully conditional specification (FCS) for metabolite concentrations [88], etc , were employed for one or more data types separately, prior to integration [33] In [107], stochastic gradient boosted trees (GBT) was employed to predict protein abundance for undetected proteins by exploiting the nonlinear correlations between available transcriptomics and proteomics data [107,116] A multi-omics imputation method that considers correlations across microRNA, mRNA and DNA methylation data, and iteratively performs self-imputations (with features from same omics data) and cross-imputations (with features from different omics data) was implemented by employing an ensemble regression framework [110] In general, it is recommended that any deterministic imputation should be done multiple times to account for the uncertainty in imputed values [113,117] Consequently, various multiple imputation (MI) methods have been proposed [118,119,120,121] In MI, instead of imputing single value for each missing data point, multiple values are imputed, resulting in multiple completed datasets rather than just one [122] The observed values are the same in each dataset, but imputed values are slightly different This difference is generally achieved by making random draws from error distribution of the regression model and adding those random draws to the values predicted by that regression model Moreover, instead of explicitly assuming that regression parameters are true parameters and not estimates, these parameters can be randomly drawn from their posterior distribution for each dataset separately [113,118,119,120] MI is an attractive approach for missing data because of its sound statistical properties and robustness established by extensive simulations Recently, a MI-based approach, referred to as MI for multiple factor analysis (MI-MFA), was proposed for multi-omics data integration [123] MI-MFA used hot-deck imputation, which is a non-parametric method commonly used in big surveys due to its scalability to a large number of variables with missing values To perform hot-deck imputation, the missing value on a variable is replaced with an observed value from a similar sample or donor Some other popular iterative MI methods include Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [118], fully conditional specification, also known as, sequential generalized regression or multivariate imputation by chained equation (MICE) [119] and AMELIA II [120] MCMC is a general method used in Bayesian statistics for various applications MCMC assumes a comprehensive joint distribution of all variables with missing data, generally applied under multivariate normal assumption A key feature of MCMC is that imputed values are never used as the basis for predicting other missing values, i e , imputations are only performed based on observed data Given all assumptions are met and enough iterations are run, MCMC is guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior distribution for the imputed values However, due to multivariate assumption and having one comprehensive model for all of the variables, MCMC may not be preferred for datasets with both quantitative and categorical variables MICE, also an iterative algorithm like MCMC, is preferred in mixed-type datasets which builds a separate regression model for each variable depending on its type MICE can also incorporate methods for imputing data that are not normally distributed [121] Unlike MCMC, MICE does not have any theoretical proof of convergence and it can also be computationally much more expensive than MCMC There is a risk of overfitting associated with any data imputation technique, but MI methods are generally less prone to this problem than single imputation methods [124] However, most software packages available for MI methods assume data is MAR When data is NMAR, extra care must be taken in date imputation to avoid overfitting and the introduction of bias in downstream analyses Various plausible models should be tried, e g , MI with pattern–mixture models [125] This should be accompanied by sensitivity analysis to verify the consistency of the results across models In addition to MI methods for missing data, there are several ways to get maximum likelihood estimates with missing data based on multivariate assumption, including expectation–minimization (EM) and direct maximization of the likelihood or full information maximum likelihood [114,123] Maximum likelihood is a general method commonly employed for parameter estimations in linear models Compared to MI, maximum likelihood approaches generally have more rigorous mathematical proofs related to parameter estimation with missing data Maximum likelihood chooses as parameter estimates those values which maximize the likelihood function, given the observation, i e , maximize the probability of observing the data The main disadvantage of maximum likelihood is that it is restricted to the type of model you want to estimate, e g , linear or logistic regression To obtain maximum likelihood with missing data, you need software that is specifically designed for the model you want to estimate, which is not always available, whereas MI methods are more general and can be employed in different types of analyses There are many software packages that automatically generate multiple imputed datasets and combine results from multiple linear regression analyses in programming software R including, jomo, mice, Amelia II, etc [120,126] Notably, most missing data approaches exist only for linear analysis For nonlinear analysis with missing data, a two-stage MI and learning workflow based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and extreme learning machine (ELM) is available [127] In order to include nonlinearity in MICE imputation, a random forest-based MICE algorithm was proposed for epidemiological study of angina patients [128] This method can accommodate nonlinearities in the datasets and provide better parameter estimates, confidence intervals under MAR assumption Deep learning techniques were recently applied to handle missing data in biomedical datasets [129,130,131,132] The success of many of these data imputation methods can be contributed to autoencoder-based nonlinear FE In [129], a multilayer autoencoder with dropout-based imputation on EHR datasets for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) clinical trials was shown to outperform popular MI techniques including MICE In addition, a denoising autoencoder (DAE)-based MI (MIDA) was also proposed very recently [130] MIDA outperformed MICE algorithm on multiple datasets from various domains including bioinformatics AutoImpute [132], inspired by recommender systems (collaborative filtering) in information retrieval, is an autoencoder-based method for single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) gene expression imputation This method learns the distribution of scRNA-seq data and imputes the dropout (i e , missing) gene expressions accordingly In scRNA-seq analysis with missing data, matrix factorization-based imputation techniques are also popular in replacing the dropout with non-zeros values For example, adaptively-thresholded low-rank approximation (ALRA) [133] computed a low-rank approximation of original matrix with missing data using singular value decomposition (SVD), followed by a thresholding to ensure that the biological zeros are preserved and technical zeros were imputed SVD-based imputation techniques have traditionally been used in biomedical datasets due to their simplicity and superior performance rather than simple mean imputation [134] Recently, the Sparse Recovery (SparRec) framework [135], also inspired by a low-rank matrix factorization model, was proposed for genetic data imputation for genome-wide association study (GWAS) It is a flexible imputation method that can be applied to large-scale meta-analysis, even without a reference panel Sequencing To Imputation Through Constructing Haplotypes (STITCH) [136] is another notable imputation technique for quick and cost-effective genotyping from sequence data without reference panel The imputation in STITCH is based on hidden Markov model (HMM) and EM algorithms In multi-omics and clinical big data analytics for precision medicine, missing data is a challenging problem [106,117] and conventional methods are prone to adding biases Specialized integrative methods, such as ensemble regression imputation [110], can perform integrative imputation by combing the estimates from individual omics data itself as well as other omics Similarly, MOFA [23] can leverage information from multiple omics layers to accurately impute missing data in integrative analysis Specifically, it discovers latent factors by means of multi-omics FE and uses those factors to impute missing data In addition, recently proposed Late Fusion Incomplete Multi-View Clustering (LF-IMVC) [137] is also attractive for multi-omics studies with missing data, where each data source with missing values can be treated as an incomplete view LF-IMVC employs a kernel matrix for each view, and performs imputation and clustering simultaneously To this end, modern statistical and machine learning methods such as MI, maximum likelihood, matrix factorization, autoencoders and integrative imputation methods can play key roles in facilitating integration of datasets with different missingness patterns Figure 3 summarizes statistical and machine learning based solutions for handling missing data Genes 10 00087 g003 550 Figure 3 Machine learning with missing data Conventional single imputation methods for handling missing data include replacement with mean or mode values, hot-deck imputation, regression imputation, k-nearest neighbor, etc Maximum Likelihood approaches including those based on an expectation-minimization (EM) algorithm and Direct Maximization have attractive statistical properties compared to the conventional methods that often result in biased parameter estimates Multiple imputation (MI) methods like Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and multivariate imputation by chained equation (MICE) are also statistically robust, compared to conventional single imputation methods, as they take into account the uncertainty in the imputed values MI for multiple factor analysis (MI-MFA) tackles the missing data problem in multi-omics analysis by performing MI based on hot-deck imputation MI for nonlinear analysis can be performed using random forest (RF) and extreme learning machine (ELM) Adaptively-thresholded low-rank approximation (ALRA), singular value decomposition (SVD)-impute and SparRec methods employ matrix factorization for data imputation In addition, imputation methods based on autoencoder and deep learning like denoising autoencoder-based MI (MIDA), AutoImpute and multilayer autoencoder (AE) have been proposed for high-dimensional datasets with missing data Recently, integrative imputation methods such as ensemble regression imputation, multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) and Late Fusion Incomplete Multi-View Clustering (LF-IMVC) are also available 5 Rarity and Class Imbalance In omics studies, ML-based models are often faced with the rarity in the target class or the class imbalance problem [12,138] For example, a machine learning classifier trained to predict the location of enhancer in the genome suffers from the class imbalance problem, i e , the dataset has many more negative samples (non-enhancer) compared to positive samples (enhancer) [12,139] Similarly, ML-based contact map prediction in a protein structure dataset also suffers from the imbalance problem because of the sparseness of the contacts, i e , of all possible amino acid pairs in a protein, only about 2% are in contact [140] Prediction of post-translation modifications (PTM) sites in a protein sequence also encounters the same problem as occurrence of PTM is a sparse event [141], i e , most of the amino acid residues are not modified Other examples of the imbalanced problem in omics studies include prediction of protein-DNA binding residues from primary sequences [142], miRNAs identification [143], mutations incidence prediction [144], DNA methylation status/sites prediction [145,146], PPI sites prediction [147,148], identification of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) functional types [149], etc In addition, the class imbalance problem in clinical datasets is prevalent due to the intrinsic imbalance in case-control pairing Experimentally, it is often challenging and costly to generate data from a treatment group as compared to a control group [150,151] Biomedical datasets belonging to the study of rare diseases or events are often severely imbalanced and most ML algorithms are not appropriate in such cases [152,153,154] Despite the pervasiveness of imbalance in class distribution in real-world datasets, most ML classifiers including SVM, RF, and artificial neural networks (ANN) assume balance class distribution This assumption means that the number of samples from each group or class is approximately the same (all categories are equally represented) [152,153] Therefore, these classifiers overestimate the majority class and potentially ignore the minority class completely Ironically, in most cases, minority class is the target class, e g , a rare disease sub-type A classifier trained on a rare disease dataset with 10,000 samples from the control group and 100 samples from the disease group can achieve 99% accuracy by predicting everything belonging to the majority class, without even detecting rare disease [155] To tackle this problem, ML methods which are aware of the skewness in data or class imbalance learning (CIL) methods have been proposed Broadly, CIL methods are divided into three categories; data sampling, algorithm modification and ensemble learning Data sampling methods are frequently employed in biomedical domains because of its simplicity [145,147,149,156,157,158] Data sampling approaches tackle class imbalance by balancing the dataset prior to applying the ML classifier The majority class can be undersampled by removing some of the samples randomly, i e , random undersampling (RUS) or informatively using one-sided selection [159] New minority class samples can be synthetically created using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) [154] Recently, a combination of undersampling and oversampling is becoming popular to tackle the imbalance problem more effectively, by overcoming the limitations associated with individual data sampling approach [145,151] Algorithm modification approaches modify the machine learning algorithm, while still using the original imbalanced dataset For example, cost-sensitive learning methods apply higher misclassification weight (cost) to minority class samples compared to majority class samples Cost-sensitive weighting are frequently incorporated in SVM, ANN and boosting learning theory to tackle class imbalance [160,161,162] Cost-sensitive learning approaches such as SVM_Weight [160] and WeightedELM (WELM) [163] are generally much more efficient than data sampling approaches, and hence attractive for big datasets [152] However, they require theoretical understanding of the algorithm, as opposed to randomly undersampling the majority class [164] Lastly, ensemble learning methods generally achieve better generalization performance than data sampling and cost-sensitive CIL methods [148,163,165,166] In various clinical scenarios, it is a common practice to seek opinions of multiple doctors who are experts in the field The final decision, for a particular treatment, is thus made by consulting a committee of experts and combining their opinions In the context of ML, ensemble learning systems play a similar role [167,168] The majority class is divided into several subsets (with or without replacement), each individual classifier in the ensemble is trained on all the minority class sample and a subset of majority class, and a final decision is based on aggregating the predictions from individual classifiers [139,142,148,163,167] EasyEnsemble, Balanced Cascade, and ensemble WELM are some examples of ensemble methods for CIL [163,167] It is important to mention that ensemble learning is a broad category of ML approaches that is not limited to class imbalance learning applications For example, it has also been employed in integrated frameworks proposed for heterogenous and missing data [25,110] Although many CIL methods exist for single omics studies, researchers have recently started developing imbalance-aware integrated omics analytical frameworks [69,169,170,171,172] In [170], extensive simulations based on different integration algorithms and evaluation measures reveal that composite association network, relevance vector machine (RVM) and Ada-boost RVM were less influenced by class imbalance compared to other graph-based or kernel-based integration algorithms A cross-organism PPI predive modelling was proposed based on tree-augmented naive Bayes (TAN) classifier (TAN relaxes the string independence assumption of NB) that integrated microarray expression and gene ontology (GO) values [173] PPI data is highly imbalanced since the number of interacting proteins is much smaller than non-interacting protein pairs Specifically, the imbalance ratio (IR) of non-interacting to interacting protein pairs was around 20 Dividing the imbalance dataset into 20 balanced datasets with the same positive samples produced better results as compared to imbalanced datasets In [73], equal-class data sampling was performed to reduce the effects of class imbalance in identifying breast cancer sub-types through the integration of protein, methylation and gene expression data A PPI prediction method based on RF was proposed which not only considered affinity purification and mass spectrometry (APMS) data, but also various other indirect features including mRNA co-expression, gene ontologies and homologous protein [174] This method, referred to as Spotlite, avoided the extreme imbalance in data, first by uniformly sampling the unknown interactions so that the IR is 10 Then, during the training of RF classifier, weights of 10 and 1 were assigned to known and unknown interaction classes, respectively For automatic function prediction (APF), a cost-sensitive network integration approach unbalance-aware network integration and prediction of protein functions (UNIPred) [175] was proposed to integrate biological networks from different data sources UNIPred addressed the imbalance between annotated and un-annotated proteins by building a consensus network from multiple protein networks derived from different omics data MNet [176] builds a composite network by integrating multiple functional networks constructed from different proteomic sources to get a comprehensive view of proteins and predict their functions The protein function prediction is an imbalanced classification problem and MNet addressed this problem by employing weighted functional labels (label represents distinct protein function), putting more emphasis on the labels that have fewer member proteins A cost-sensitive SVM approach was proposed for diagnosing pancreatic cancer by integrating miRNA and mRNA expression data [177] The dataset was imbalanced as there were 104 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tissues and 17 benign pancreatic tissues Therefore, class specific weights in SVM for cancer and normal samples were set to 1 and 6 117647 (104/17), respectively Using their integrated approach, they were able to identify 705 multi-markers for 27 miRNAs and 289 genes as promising potential biomarkers for pancreatic cancer The generalized simultaneous component analysis (GSCA) model, with GDP penalty, was proposed recently for the integrative analysis of gene expression and CNA [178] This method was found to be more robust against class imbalance problem in CNA compared to iCluster+ method In [179], authors showed that a simple ensemble learning method can work as well as state-of-the-art data integration methods such as kernel fusion The ensemble comprised learners which were trained on different views of data and the predictions were combined using weighted majority voting (WMV) The weight was determined using F-score that considered the imbalance between gene classes Apart from data sampling, algorithm modification and ensemble learning based methods, some integration frameworks which perform model tuning based on CIL-specific evaluation measures were proposed recently Traditional evaluation measures like overall accuracy are not appropriate for CIL [172] The accuracy of the majority class (specificity) and the accuracy of the minority class (sensitivity) should be measured in a balanced way Therefore, geometric mean (Gmean) of sensitivity and specificity is a commonly used evaluation measure for CIL [153] Similarly, area under precision-recall curve (auPRC) provides more unbiased evaluation compared to the area under receiver operating characteristic (auROC) Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and F-scores also take into account imbalance in class sizes F-score, which incorporates precision and recall, is a popular evaluation metric in information retrieval community [170] MCC [14,145] considers true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives in its formula It can have a value between −1 and 1; 1 means perfect prediction, 0 means random prediction and −1 means total disagreement Balanced error rate (BER) calculates the average proportion of incorrectly classified samples in each class, weighted by the number of samples in each class To address the imbalance problem in multi-omics predictive modelling, BER was incorporated as an evaluation measure for parameter tuning, through cross-validation, in data integration analysis for biomarker discovery using latent components (Diablo) [69,171] Diablo is a multi-omics integrative framework which can identify biomarker panels that discriminate between different disease phenotypes It transforms each omics dataset into latent components, and maximizes the correlations between these components and phenotype of interest A novel neural network architecture incorporating cross-correlation between different modalities (e g , gene expression and DNA methylation) was proposed in [172] to classify breast cancer patients This method, referred to as super-layered neural network architecture (SNN), utilized MCC and F-scores to account for the imbalance in class sizes In general, most methods and evaluation measures for CIL are proposed for binary class problems, i e , there are only two categories in the dataset However, multi-omics data analysis and hypothesis generation may involve more than two classes [66], with a varying degree of imbalance among them [172] For example, instead of normal vs disease samples, there can be different types or levels of diseases [72,157,163,172,180] In recent years, researchers have started focusing on multi-class imbalance problems [152,163,181] Fuzzy pattern random forest (FPRF) [181] employed multi-class version of F-score and Gmean for robust feature selection in the integrative analysis of an imbalanced Leukemia dataset Due to the inherent sparsity in various omics phenomena, rare events in diseases of interest and case-control imbalance in clinical studies, it is anticipated that integrated omics studies will present new challenges in predictive modelling and provide opportunities for researchers to propose specialized CIL algorithms For example, beyond simple data sampling approaches, biomedical researchers can explore ensemble and algorithmic modification methods that generally have better theoretical foundations, natural scalability to multi-class classification, and lower risks of overfitting and information loss than data sampling approaches Figure 4 shows categorization of class imbalance machine learning methods Genes 10 00087 g004 550 Figure 4 Machine learning with class imbalance Class imbalance learning (CIL) methods are broadly classified into three types: data sampling, cost-sensitive learning and ensemble methods Data sampling approaches balance the class distribution by either undersampling the majority class (e g , random under sampling (RUS)), oversampling the minority class (e g , synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE)), or a combination of both (hybrid) Algorithm modification methods modify the learning algorithm generally by cost-sensitive weighting (e g , Mnet, unbalance-aware network integration and prediction of protein functions (UNIPred), Spotlite and support vector machine (SVM)_weight) Cost-sensitive learning assigns a higher misclassification cost to minority class samples compared to majority class samples Ensemble learning approaches like ensemble with weighted majority voting, EasyEnsemble, Balanced Cascade, and ensemble weighted extreme learning machine (WELM) train multiple classifiers, and aggregate their results to get the final output Many existing integrative methods tackle imbalance by tuning models based on imbalance-aware evaluation measures For example, data integration analysis for biomarker discovery using latent components (Diablo), super-layered neural network architecture (SNN), fuzzy pattern random forest (FPRF), and weighted majority voting (WMV) employ one or more CIL-specific evaluation measures like F-score, balanced error rate (BER), geometric mean (Gmean), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), area under precision-recall curve (auPRC), etc , instead of classification accuracy, to account for the bias introduced by imbalance in the dataset 6 Big Data Scalability Machine learning algorithms build data driven models whose performance generally gets better with the availability of more data However, machine learning from big data acquired via multiple high-throughput omics platforms may raise scalability challenges Implementation of multi-omics analytical workflows based on ML methods is increasingly becoming infeasible on a single computer However, with the advancement in optimization algorithms for big data, online ML, parallelization of ML algorithms, and cloud computing, large-scale analysis can be performed efficiently on high-dimensional omics datasets For example, a feed-forward neural network with multiple hidden layers can now be trained to accurately differentiate non-coding RNA types, i e , circular RNAs (cirRNAs) from long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in just a few hours on a single computer while the MKL method would take four days [182] This is possible due to the development of computationally efficient training algorithms for neural networks [183,184,185] Biomedical researchers can achieve large-scale machine learning by leveraging the computational approaches discussed below, as shown in Figure 5 Genes 10 00087 g005 550 Figure 5 Large-scale machine learning ML-based integrative analysis can be performed at large-scale by utilizing computationally efficient algorithms proposed for big data, online training algorithms, distributed data processing and computing frameworks, or cloud computing-based solutions Efficient computational approaches tailored for big data include non-iterative neural networks (e g , extreme learning machine (ELM) and random vector functional link (RVFL)), scalable multiple kernel learning (MKL) methods (e g , easyMKL and dual-layer kernel ELM (DKELM)), convex optimization for big data, etc Online machine learning algorithms including online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM), incremental decremental support vector machine (IDSVM), and online deep learning are attractive for big data applications as they incrementally update the model with small chunks of data, instead of loading entire data in memory and learning all at once In addition, ML algorithms can now be massively parallelized over a cluster of CPUs or graphics processing units (GPUs) using Spark’s MLlib, Apache Mahout, and Google’s TensorFlow programming frameworks Cloud computing-based bioinformatics platforms including Galaxy Cloud, MetaboAnalyst, XCMS online, and Omics pipe are useful resources for multi-omics exploratory data analysis (EDA) and ML Moreover, machine learning-as-a-service is being offered by leading commercial cloud service providers like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and IBM, which can be utilized for implementing ML-based analytical pipelines in large-scale multi-omics studies Various ML methods including ANN, SVM and DT estimate model parameters through iterative procedures; thus, they may not be easily scalable to big data applications In recent years, there have been many efforts to optimize algorithms for training ML models efficiently on large datasets [183,184,186,187] For example, non-iterative training algorithms are becoming popular for big data applications [187] ANN can be trained in a single step without iterative tuning of hidden node parameters, as opposed to a back-propagation (BP) algorithm which is time-consuming, converges slowly, and can be stuck at local minima [183] Non-iterative solutions for ANN include extreme learning machine (ELM) [188], random vector functional link (RVFL) [189,190], liquid state machine [191], echo state network [192], etc In most of these methods, weights connecting input layer to hidden layer are randomly assigned, and output weights connecting hidden layer to output layer are determined analytically Therefore, computational complexity of non-iterative methods is much lower than traditional BP methods for ANN Furthermore, a highly parallel implementation of ELM for big data has been proposed by employing large-scale optimization [186] Specifically, convex optimization, a key competent in training many ML and statistical models, is being reinvented for scalability and parallelism in the wake of big data [193] Recently, methods based on ELM theory have been employed in single omics studies [163,182,194,195,196,197] and may be extended to multi-omics for efficient integrative analyses Moreover, scalable MKL methods like dual-layer kernel extreme learning machine (DKELM) [198] and easyMKL [199] can be employed in multi-omics integrative analysis since MKL, a popular approach for integrating multiple omics datasets, can be computationally very expensive for large datasets Online algorithms are also useful in big data applications, especially when it is computationally infeasible to train models on the entire dataset all at once [200] They are extremely popular in data stream analytics where the training samples arrive over time, e g , in online prediction of glucose concentration in Type I diabetes [201] Instead of retraining the model with the entire dataset every time new samples are received, online learning methods incrementally update the earlier learnt model only with the new samples Previously learnt samples need not be stored in memory On the other hand, batch ML algorithms would perform intensive training iterations over the entire dataset every time new samples arrive In addition, batch learning requires complete datasets to be available in the memory prior to training, which may not be feasible in large-scale applications Recursive least squares, a sequential (online) implementation of least squares method, is the building block of many online learning algorithms For example, online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) [202] is a family of algorithms based on recursive least squares formulation for online training of single hidden layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) OS-ELM based algorithms can learn data one sample at a time or as chunks of samples, and have been employed for nonlinear classification and regression applications Stochastic gradient decent (SGD), a variant of BP algorithm, is also a popular online optimization algorithm for training ML models [203] SVM-based online learning algorithms such as incremental decremental SVM (IDSVM) and cost-sensitive learning-based online SVM [204,205] were proposed to address scalability issues in big data applications Recently, multi-layer or deep online learning methods were proposed for better representation learning with high-dimensional datasets These deep learning approaches are memory efficient as entire datasets need not be stored in memory, making them attractive for large-scale multi-omics analysis [206,207] Online learning algorithms are now available for common ML tasks such as classification, regression, feature extraction, clustering, deep learning, etc Institutions can also leverage distributed implementations of ML algorithms, on a cluster of computers, when standalone commodity PCs lack the computational power required to learn from big data For example, the MapReduce [208,209] programming framework provides a distributed platform to process big data in a fault tolerant way and can facilitate the scalability of ML algorithms on large biomedical datasets Simply put, distributed frameworks like MapReduce and its open-source implementation Hadoop [210] divide the training data into many subsets such that each subset is processed by a single machine or slave Slave machines perform operations in parallel and results are combined by a centralized master server MapReduce is a good candidate for scaling those learning algorithms which can be expressed as computing sums of function of training data Recently, a clustering algorithm KAymeans for MIxed LArge data (KAMILA) [211] was implemented on very large dataset using Hadoop [212] KAMILA can be useful in multi-omics analysis since it was proposed for mixed-type data (combination of continuous and categorical data) clustering From the original MapReduce framework, various computational platforms have arisen which are suitable for large-scale ML, such as Apache Spark [213] These cluster computing platforms efficiently perform multiple iterations of matrix inversions and multiplications which are associated with many ML algorithms Spark’s MLlib [214] is a suite of scalable algorithms, providing distributed implementations of popular ML methods including regression models, PCA, k-means clustering, DT, Naïve Bayes, SVM, etc Another open-source project that allows distributed implementation of ML algorithms for big data is Apache Mahout [215] Mahout was successfully employed for scalable feature selection, data sampling and classification in protein structure prediction problems [140] In addition, Google’s TensorFlow programming model [216] allows parallelism of deep leaning approaches [31] such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms, by distributed implementation on many CPUs or graphics processing units (GPUs) for large-scale analysis If memory and computational resources required for integrative analysis is beyond what is available in the cluster of a research lab or institution, cloud computing is an attractive option Galaxy Cloud [217,218] allows users to run a private Galaxy installation on Amazon Web Services (AWS) elastic compute cloud (EC2) with the same functionalities as the main site using a virtual machine model Omics pipe [219], an open source Python framework for automating multi-omics data analysis, is also available as Amazon virtual machine XCMS online [220] is a cloud-based metabolomics data processing platform for predictive pathway analysis and enables multi-omics data analysis by integrating gene and protein data with metabolic pathways MetaboAnalyst [221] is another cloud-based platform for integrative metabolomics analysis It incorporates modules for multi-omics data integration through knowledge-based network analysis and various ML-based clustering, feature selection and classification algorithms In addition to cloud-based bioinformatics platforms, machine learning-as-a-service is being offered by leading commercial cloud service providers like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and IBM ML-as-a-service makes implementation of complex ML algorithms on large-scale datasets convenient for biomedical researchers [222] It is apparent that the future of multi-omics integrative analysis is reliant on ML algorithms, and cloud-based solutions provide feasible options to implement them at large-scale 7 Conclusions and Future Perspectives High-throughput omics technologies are generating large volumes of multi-omics data at an unprecedented rate Simultaneous analysis of data obtained from different platforms, for the same biological specimen, captures a holistic view of the complex biological interactions For single-omics studies, traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms have been very successful in automatically identifying complex patterns from big data However, multi-omics integrative analysis poses new computational challenges and amplifies the ones associated with single-omics studies In this paper, we focused on five computational problems frequently encountered in integrative multi-omics data analysis, including the curse of dimensionality, data heterogeneity, missing data, rarity and class imbalance, and scalability issues We reviewed some novel ML-based approaches recently applied to integrative analysis of multi-omics datasets, under each of the five problem categories Furthermore, we also discussed state-of-the-art computational methods which have the potential to address these problems in multi-omics analysis This article will help bioinformatics researchers in exploring modern computational approaches to tackle evolving challenges in integrative analysis It also bridges the gap between problems in multi-omics integrative analysis, and novel machine learning approaches from the computer science community as potential solutions to these problems Although this article addressed some key issues in integrative data analysis, there are other challenges that require attention in future studies For example, specialized ML-based approaches need to be developed for multi-omics analysis in personalized medicine where cohort size can be very small (e g , 100 patients or less) [223] Moreover, additional machine learning frameworks which leverage prior knowledge of biological networks to integrate omics datasets should be proposed as they are vital for robust biomarker modelling [224,225,226] In the integrative analysis of omics data and electronic health records (EHR) [227], or observational data and biomedical literature, sophisticated text mining and natural language processing approaches may play key roles to simultaneously handle structured and unstructured data [228,229,230] However, the privacy and security of patient data should be ensured when developing ML approaches with EHRs and multi-omics Integrative studies must comply with standards like Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) and any prediction or outcome from ML analysis must not compromise patient confidentiality Collaborative studies can greatly benefit from privacy-preserving machine learning frameworks as institutions can jointly train accurate ML models without sharing sensitive patient data [231,232] Finally, there is a need to benchmark ML methods for multi-omics analysis as numerous methods are available to solve the same problem Although there are ongoing efforts to benchmark machine learning algorithms [233], benchmarking specific to multi-omics is required Hello, everyone!

I will just type, and type, and never, ever use copy and paste Wow I really must be bored Just goes to show what boredom can do to you Any way, that's it for now Wait, no it isn't, I still have to keep going, and going, and going Because I do THE REST OF THE STUFF I TYPE WILL BE COMPLETLY IN CAPS JUST BECAUSE I CAN THAT IS ALL SEEYA! Hi, I'm back So far this is nowhere near the world record I think I don't exactly know where it is oh, well I'll just have to do the very best that I can No one is really coming here, anyway So it doesn't matter By the way, TAB is a worthwhile, community-service organization The form link is to a 100% fake TAB registration form that you can fill out just for laughs I can't believe I'm bothering to do this I have very low expectations of my site None ever comes here, I could do this all day long and I still wouldn't have any more hits This is just a pointless excursive in spelling errors and grammatical imprecision May your day be shiney! The following is an extremely weird poem-thingy that I wrote when I was in a relatively weird mood: never mind that noise my dear can anyone pass the cheese only if you say pretty please oh, boy do I have to sneeze why must everyone always rhyme, why I’m a poet and don’t I know it? what I fear comes right after here not this life or the next will I ever be able to pass the test? we’re stuck in here, (alone my dear) and we’ll problem never get out so don’t start to shout it’s dark and I want to go home is where the heart was where is it now? we’ll never know but oh crap it’s starting to snow and it’s time to show and tell about the well that you found last summer at camp when it was damp it was near the ramp oh god why must this be I liked that tree but now it’s gone, farewell so long I’ll miss you as long as you write but then I’m afraid to say good-night my dear there’s nothing to fear that’s only a box that’s made of blocks next to the wagon that looks like a dragon why are you shaking it’s your fear that is making you shiver and act all a quiver don’t you know that you only need be afraid of fear and never anything here and certainly not a post that acts like a ghost? See, very weird At least it fills up my word quota for the day Not that I exactly have a word quota for the day It just sounded very professional to say it Anyway, I still don't think that anyone is actually coming here You'd have to be an absolute loser (or really bored) to come here I'd probley come here, but that isn't much of a surprise After all, I've been to the Really Really Big Button That Doesn't Do Anything website over 50 times Pathetic But, whatever As long as I'm happy, right Humor the crazy person, okay? Oh, guess what? According to someone you problem don't know, this is the second most pointless website ever! Next to the Really Big Button, of course I feel special Come on everyone, group hug Okay, now I'm starting to scare myself I'm gonna quit for today Seeya Now I'm back Is this getting confusing to you? Too bad Now I want you to go to http://quiz ravenblack net/blood pl?biter=eon" If you do this I'll get points in the game Come on all you non-existing people! Help me! You know you want to! It's a worthy cause! Honestly, the more time I waste playing the game, the less time I'll work on this site and the less stuff you gotta read Although why you'd be here if you didn't want to read is beyond me Maybe you're lost Okay, if you want to get out, click the little refresh button, okay? Good what? You say it didn't let you out? Oh, well You must be caught in a time warp Keep pressing it Maybe you'll break free What's that The little counter at the bottom keeps going up? Never mind That's just how many times you have to click before you can leave Good-bye Hey, I'm once again: back I don't suppose you fell for that little thing about the refresh button After all, you're a responsible, intelligent person who apparently has a lot of time on your hands Well, you can't possibly have more time than I do I mean, after all, I made this site You're only browsing it And most people don't even come here Not even my friends *sniffle* The just ignore this poor, pathetic little page All they do is fill out the TAB form and leave I think Maybe they're here right now! HI! HOW ARE YOU DOING? I'M FINE! THANKS FOR COMING! YES, I'M YELLING! Who am I kidding This page won't get a single hit, unless I bribe people now that has possibilities Okay, fill out the TAB form, so I have proof that you bothered to come here and uh I'll uh send you a sandwich? Please allow 6-8 weeks for delivery I'm bored I'm gonna go hug a moose MOOSE! I love-d you moose! Hey, I'm back again! Yea *waits for applause* okay! Now I want all you loyal fans *cricket chirps* to go to the link to see what I'm like I took a whole bunch of personality quizzes and posted them there I'm an evil villain, kitty and a freakazoid so far And I only took the quiz once, too Spooky how accurate they are anyway, I command you to go! I'm going I'm back I'm gonna start counting how many times I say back Let's see: 1 2 3 4 5! Wow I must really be desperate for something to do I now officially have proof that someone has been here! It was one of my friends Apparently this page really is getting long, because my friend said something to that effect Maybe Anyway, moving on! I'm just basically typing nothing Just like all those reports people have to do You know? With a specific number of words They start out with half that number, and then just fill in words until they have the right amount I salute those people You're great tradition is being carried out here, on the second most pointless site ever! Well Maybe eventually some weird, bored person will wander onto my site on accident and be mildly entertained be my site until they wander onto a live video feed of a coffee maker Or maybe not I only know that I'm entertaining me, which was my original goal So I've done what I've set out to accomplish Yea, me! I'm so special You see, most people, they don't like reading or writing So if you're not most people, you've made it down this far without skipping, skimming or getting the spark notes version (Which I think does not exist) My point is, if you've bothered to read this, then, (like me) you probley have also read the ketchup bottle so many times that you have it down verbatim Look verbatim up It's a word But, you should know that, since you like reading Or maybe you're just skimming Anyway, there's nothing wrong with reading food labels You might be asked a question about them on a quiz show And now, for the million-dollar question: How many calories are there in a single serving of Mustard? I can just see it now It could be called Know-Your-Food Or You are What you Eat It'd probley be as popular as those game shows that no one's ever heard of Speaking of food, what's up with pie? There's strawberry pie, apple, pumpkin and so many others, but there is no grape pie! I know I'm just as upset about this unfortunate lack of development in the pie division Think about it Grapes are used to make jelly, jam, juice and raisins What makes them undesirable for pie? Would they dry into raisins? Couldn't you just stick some jelly in a piecrust and bake it? It just doesn't make any sense Another thing that bothers me is organ grinders You know, the foreign guys with the bellhop hats and the little music thingy and the cute little monkey with the bellhop hat who collects the money? Okay They're basically begging on the street How did they ever afford an organ-thingy? Wouldn't it make more sense to get a kazoo, if you're broke? And if they're so poor, what possessed them to buy a monkey? I mean, I don't think I could afford a monkey, and I'm not exactly on the streets Obviously I at least have a computer so, back to the organ grinders I would have sold the monkey and the organ and been able to eat for at least a year Or, if I was weirder than I am, I could at least kill the monkey with the organ and eat it Why on earth did they keep the monkey? It must have cost a fortune to feed not to mention the mess That's just one of those many facts of life that are better left mysteries Especially since no one but me would ask the question I better go I think I hear a monkey Okay now I'm back That's the sixth time I've said back! I realize that this longest text ever must be very boring and not worth anyone's time But I'd like to take this time to thank the 2 and 1/2 people in the entire universe who have bothered to read this entire thing I'm not exactly sure who they are, but: thanks! Right now, my spacebar is malfunctioning that's not good I have to press it two or three times just to insert a freaking space Maybe the evil little faeries with the sharp little teeth have put their evil faerie dust on my computer Or maybe not This is too frustrating Goodbye for now Now I'm back And still frustrated But for a different reason Today I had the misfortune of playing a Treasure Planet game on neopets com It was terrible Apparently the point of the game was to get your character to shout "Whoo-Hoo!" as many times as possible before you splattered your brains on the rocks, all the while listening to a soundtrack that is similar to a dying ceiling fan Of course, when I started out I accidentally hit the rocks approximately three million times Halfway though I used my four remaining brain-cells to decide that the game was dumb So my goal changed from surviving to laughing evilly while my character died So the game naturally did everything it could to preserve my life The stupid game is still going on and I refuse to quit because I want my points My character is actually dodging the stupid rocks better now then when I controlled him I hate irony Seeya Okay Now I'm back again Today I added an update page, which is basically a less chaotic, outlined version of this without all the ranting It's more like techno talk about arrays and how much I suck and whether or not the Braves will win this year Okay, the whole braves thing is made up But everything else I've said so far is true I think Maybe I should start on a boring disclaimer Eh-hem All contents of this site were designed for entertainment purposes only Any use thereof that is not stated in the above mentioned statement would make the author, hereby referred to as Patron Saint of Paper Clips, very angry Should you violate the purpose of this site: i e become not entertained, the Patron Saint of Paper Clips will be forced to take drastic measures This is specified in Code: 343 of the Flaming Chicken Handbook Ooooo…that’s a great idea! I’m gonna start quoting from the Flaming Chicken Handbook! Code: 343 of the Flaming Chicken Handbook states that the Patron Saint of Paper Clips (that’s me) is allowed to cause vague, pain like sensations while the offending person (or alien life form, dog, etc ) isn’t paying attention Now I have a purpose in life! To make up quotes from the non-existent Flaming Chicken Handbook, which I’m sure you have a copy of No? Too bad It’s in the mail, I promise! Now I must take my leave…and remember Cheese is watching Okay I'm back I think that eventually half of this thing will consist of the word back over and over again that's just weird Which fits the motif of the rest of the site There's even a money back guarantee Isn’t' that nice? See? Now no one can ever say that I don't take care of my viewers Especially since I don't have viewers I have readers Wait I really don't even know if anyone bothers to read this Even if I put it in a less chaotic, more user-friendly format people would still ignore this because it involves: reading Yes Sad to admit, but the majority of people would rather read the summary at the back of a book rather than the whole book itself What has the world come to? It's pathetic Especially since I'm bothering to write all this It's not fair! Why can't I have more readers?! All the other internet writers have nothing on me, except they're better at advertising, having a central theme/plot and basically more talented Whereas I'm more into the whole ranting and raving stage right now Plus, I am horrible at spelling Which is bad Thank the powers that be for spell-check The single greatest invention of the computer gods I'm getting bored, so I think I'm done for the day May your day be shiney! I'm back again! And I feel weird! I found at that yet another one of my friends is reading this Creepy Just how much time do they have on their hands Perhaps their just trying to be nice I can just see it now an organization devoted not to feeding the hungry, or peace, or love or whatever, but to giving recognition to all those poor, pathetic, unpopular websites I wonder what it's name would be Don't Ignore Sites? Would it be called DIS? Isn't that like a slang term for an insult? Would that be considered poetic justice, or just a nice coincidence? And why do I even care? I'll tell you why Because I have nothing else to do right now I could be playing neopets, but ever since my bad experience with Treasure Planet, I don't feel like it Oh, by the way, I noticed that whenever I use spell-check, my stupid computer turns the word probley into to word problem To prevent this, I did nothing So, it is now up to you, the imaginary reader, to decide whether I mean probley or problem it's almost like a game! But without the bad sound track And I promise not to force you to live when you would rather die Moving on, I have nothing else to say, but don't feel like quitting just yet I'm like the little engine that could Or maybe the Energizer Bunny I just keep going, and going and going Or I could be like that annoying guy on T V who keeps asking if you can hear him If my site manages to last a decade, my readers *snicker* will probley wonder what I'm talking about My answer is simple It doesn't matter I'm just rambling Which means that it doesn't matter if you understand anything I say Doesn't that make you feel better? I bet it does Wow Look how long this has gotten I even impress myself Who would have thought I have this much free time? And I congratulate any reader who has gotten this far Ooooooo! You must check out the fortunes section of the random stuff page! I've just gotten an idea for some more, original, fortunes I gotta go!(may the moose be with you) And now I am back I swear If iI fill out the fake tab form I'm gonna have to put back as my favorite word I already have filled it out, though Would it be cheating to fill it out again? Only if I had multiple personalities Or would it be cheating if I didn't have multiple personalities? The world may never know Just like how many licks it takes to get to the bottom of a tootsie pop Would it vary? The number of licks, I mean Someone could have super-disolving spit, or watery-spit Or what if you took big ol' slobbery licks? Does the commercial take that into account? No It doesn't And let me tell you, it's an outrage It deludes all of American's sweet, innocent, candy-loving children into thinking that a cartoon owl is smarter than they are! "Mr Owl, can you tell us how many licks does it take to get to the bottom of a tootsie pop?" Or whatever And "Mr Owl" replies "One Twoo Three! Chomp" And he bites it That teaches our youth that it's okay to agree to help someone, and then ruin their experiment Well it's not I am going to start a protest group Teens Against Cartoon Owls We could call ourselves TACO! I love the little tacos, I love them good! That is a direct quote from GIR, co-star and comic-relief on INVADER ZIM Hmmmm intersting I put hyphens in both of his titles it must be a conspiracy! I gotta go Those TACO buttons don't make themselves, you know I'm back again And not so cheesed off about the whole tootsie roll pop thing Right now, I have another twenty minutes on the Internet before I'm gonna watch T V And I can't think of anything else to do So, predictably, here I am It's not like I have anything better to do Obviously, you know this After all, look how long this text is I wonder if I've made the world record? If I did, would I stop this? Why bother asking? I'll will most likely still be adding to this on my death bed Hmmmmm has any old, senile person ever written anything? Was it coherent? Did it make more sense that this text? Is it possible to make less sense? Am I enjoying asking retorical questions? Yes Yes, I am But I seriously wonder what something written by a senile person would be like I've heard of poems and stuff written by people who were high, insane or paranoid But never senile Can a senile person write? Aren't they regressed to a child-like state? Does it even matter? Is anyone even reading this? Did I resume asking retorical questions? Do you care? Is this eating up time? I feel like I'm playing questions only on whose line is it anway I probley should have capitalized something, or underlined but I'm feeling lazy hey, you try to keep your two and a half readers happy! It's really stressfull Someday, I'm gonna snap and just delete this entire thing Gee, I hope not! I worked sorta hard on this It's great for making random topics weave together to form an overall infrastructure of chaos That made little sense That's why it's here, and not some critically acclaimed site Ooooooooooooo! I'm gonna quote from the FLAMING CHICKENS HANDBOOK again! Yep! I bet you were just breathless in anticipation Okay Here goes Code: 472 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that this site in no way acknowledges the existance of other, better sites (hereon reffered to as the Losers) The Losers are a myth The Patron Saint of Paper Clips (me again!) claims no knowledge as to where that particullary nasty rumor started, but confirms that this is the best site ever It would be a sin against humanity for a better site to exist Should you refuse to acknowledge the Patron Saint of Paper Clips as the ruler of the Internet, you will be subjected to punishment as stated in Code 343 of the Flaming Chicken Handbook (i e Experience vague, pain-like sensations when you're not paying attention) This has been a public service announcement This is a test, I repeat only a test Had this been an actual emergency, we would have bought up all the can openers and charged 3 cows and a pig for each one I repeat, lock all you doors and windows, this is it I repeat, there is nothing to worry about Everything is fine The end is not here I'm going, you're on you're own! Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm back!*smiles brightly* And apparantly delusional! Anyway, I just finished rereading my longest text ever And I became inspired to talk about nothing You see, I periodically read the longest text ever to check the constant downward spiral of my sanity Hmmm I seem to be entertaining myself though, even while reading what I wrote Which is why I still go to the Really Really Big Button That Doesn't Do Anything website Because I am easily amused and have lots and lots of time on my hands Maybe, some day far in the future (like next Thursday) I'll print a copy of this insane text And then go door to door distributing it Eventually, this would become a monthly tradition Whole families would gather around their front door, in breathless anticipation while they attempted to barracade me out I can just see the whole community rising to thwart my attempts to spread love, joy and insane chaos I probley wouldn't actually print this out (think how much paper it would take!) but if I do, only friends and enemies will receive copies Hmmmm maybe my condition is worsening Or not I'm still peeved about the cartoon owl from the Tootsie Roll Pop commercials He is pure evil TACO will eventually destroy him Unless he has already been destroyed by an even more radical Anti-Cartoon-Owl group I hope not Or, would that be good? I suppose I could let someone else have the glory After all, I'm not in this line of buisness for the fame, fortune and power What line of buisness, do you ask? Why, the assasinating annoying cartoon characters buisness (Actually I just question them untill they spontaneously combust, I ask lots of questions) So, in conclusion, ladies and gentleman of the jury(that's you) I could not have possibly tortured "Mr Owl" to death I love owls Hmm I seem to be jumping from one subject to another more frequently Either I am growing more comfortable with my on-line writing, or I am progressivly getting more insane and chaotic I also am psyco-analyzing myself a lot today hmmmm I'm even saying "hmmmmm " a lot Just like a real psychologist Hmmmmmmm Time for another boring disclaimer!!!!!!! Code: 742 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that in no part does the Patron Saint of Paper Clips (That's still me!) actually claim to be mentally ill That's either a) a publicity stunt b) An attempt at humor c) a cry for help or d) none of the above You can e-mail your responses by conducting a scavenger hunt of this site Some of the pages of this site contain a link encouging the two and a half people to e-mail the Patron Saint of Paper Clips There may also be evil little links that are designed to confuse you These links send stuff to someone named johnjones333@hotmail com The Patron Saint of Paper Clips does not know who this individual is, but sincerly wishes that you send all your hate mail to him Not that the aformentioned individual claims to have received hate mail (or mail of any kind) via a website link Thank-you for your time Remember to send your answers to my sanity quiz to the e-mail account, flamingchickens333@hotmail com Oh, and once I refer to myself in the first person again, the handbook quote is over I just thought that I might like to mention that Oh You're still here I figured you rush right on over to e-mail me Perhaps you don't have time to waste e-mailing me HA! HA! HA! That's funny!!!! If you you don't have time to waste, what are you doing here?!!! Oh, who am I kidding I figure that even the people I manage to lure onto my site from neopets don't even bother to come to this particular page Maybe I should make the link come here directly Hey! What a good idea! That way I can spread my love, joy and insane chaos to more people! I'm a genius Gotta go, must lure innocent victems to the second most pointless site ever!!!! I'm back And really angry, and confused I've always known that I was weird, that's always been a given But now I realize that I am considerably more normal than the rest of my family Today we had a "family outing " Now, most families will go bowling, or putt-putt golfing They may go to a resteraunt with an arcarde, or the movies or to a theme park Not my family! No, we got the greatest family outing of all We got to go to a bar and play pool!!!!!*waits for readers to become insanely jealous* Yep, that's right, a bar with a pool table! Not only did we get world class cuisine (under-cooked hotdogs and over-cooked hamburgers), my little sister (age 10) got taught pool by someone I strongly supect is an ex-convict! Naturally when it was announced that we'd be eating dinner in this place, I could hardly contain my excitment(I glared at my mother and asked why we couldn't go to Pizza Hut) When we arrived, we were promptly served (after thirty minutes) In the meantime, we played a family game of pool(my parents played while my brother and sister and I watched) After two rousing rounds, our food came The food was superb, (our food came the exact opposite of how we ordered it, and half of the onion rings were missing) Then we joyfully returned to our game(my sister and the ex-con played my mom) We spent hours there (from 5p m -7:15p m ) There were many people that were the same age as me and my siblings (no one in the room but us were under 30) Us kids had to be dragged kicking and screaming from the bar ( I almost fell asleep during the last game I watched) As we left, there was a feeling of goodwill and fellowship between all(my sister locked me out of the car and wouldn't let me in untill I started yelling profanity in her general direction) The high point of the entire night was when my mother gave me $21 for my report card She promptly borrowed $1 to help with the waitresses tip(This part I'm not being sarcastic about) All in all it was a night I'll remember forever (as the lowest point in "family outing"history, except for that time my mom dragged me to a church thing on the concept of truth ) My brother(age 13) even decided upon a new job he wants when he's old enough to work, a busboy at the bar We had to tell him that he would probley have to wait untill he was 21 (Absolutly nothing about that statement was sarcastic) As you can see, I love my families outings(Not unless you're blind or stupid) &#!#%&&!!!(*%$ WHAT THE %$#@ WAS MY MOTHER $#$#%$# THINKING!!!!!!!???? BRINGING $#$$# KIDS IN A BAR!? I know it was her idea, 'cause my dad hates it, too My mom and my stupid little 10-year old sister loves it, though *sighs* Why does my life have to be so weird? I'm leaving now I'm back! And not so pissed at my weird family Now is the time to mourn the loss of one of my most loyal readers (I think she's read the entire thing one time, which is more than anyone else has done so far) She has been banned from accesing any portion of the Internet, do to reasons that must remain confidental due to security reasons If I told you, I'd have to kill you and all that stuff So now I am down to one and a half readers Untill such time that I have more I wonder why anyone would read this? You would have to have several characteristics that I possess First of all, you'd have to have an extrodinary amount of free time Second of all, you would have to have the patience to read through all of this And lastly, you'd have to know where the heck this site is I admit it I haven't exactly advertised this site Nor can I find it on any search engines Some of my pages have stuff written in to make search engines recognize me, but it doesn't seem to be working What must I do to rise above obscurity? I tell people I know about this site, but they either ignore this page, or don't even bother coming to the site in the first place I suppose that is the bane of all authors To pour your heart and soul into a passage, and have everyone ignore it *sniffle* Why must this be? Maybe I should just give up After all, no one would really care if I quit updating this site But I can't help but think of stuff like the evil over lord list and REALLY REALLY BIG BUTTON THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING They are not great neccesarily because of the content, (although that helps some) they are great because of their sheer length You can read a little each day And almost never finish Also, I guess I still am trying to get the world record I have heard some feedback suggesting that I make someway for people to remember where they stopped reading It can be very confusing, especially if you weren't paying attention in the first place Well, I dont want to organize this page, in any manner This is chaos And insanity Not neat little text in classifiable rows, in alphabetical order If you want neat, go to some other site(though, as mentioned in Flaming Chickens Code:472 there is no such thing as a site better than this one) Otherwise, I guess you're stuck with me Awwwww I'm touched! You didn't run screaming to another site, thankfull for the chance to escape this insanity You're still here, which must mean that you'd rather be here than anywhere else! Hey, where are you going?! I thought you were gonna stay here and keep me company?! *drags reader back* See, I knew you'd stay! *gagged reader glares* What's that? I know this is the best site ever, thanks for the compliment! *reader starts inching towards freedom* I better go I think that I may have a problem brewing I'm back And very concerned about this new, younger generation (all 10 year olds who were born in 1992) They are supposed to be the future Instead they appear to be a nuclear armagedon in the form of a fifth grader I chanced to have an interview with an informant from this evil generation (my little sister) who will be called Mrs X for security reasons (no, she's not married, the "Mrs" makes it good as a disguise) I was quizing Mrs X on Civil War History for an upcoming test in her classroom (whose location can not be devulged) Mrs X seemed fluent in the subject Using prior knowledge, I deduced that Mrs X was full of crap Out of sheer curiosity, I asked Mrs X who participated in the Civil War She immediatly replied "Clara Barton" I clarified, which countries fought in the Civil War She answered: England, Russia, and (out of sheer desperation) Iraq I believe that she was just listing countries she knows America has fought against Now, correct me if I'm wrong but Iraq? I don't know if Iraq even existed in the Civil War Era! Why on earth would we go have way across the world to fight them when we didn't even really need oil?!! Moving on, I finaly managed to coax my sister (I'm tired of writing Mrs X) to tentativly guess that America fought in the Civil War I mean, who'd a thought? America? Fighting in the American Civil War? In a moment of inspiration, I asked her who America fought Her first guess was enslaved africans Well, at least she knows that slaves were involved in the war Before she could start listing all of America's enemies, I gave her a hint I said "The Union fought " With a crack, snaple and pop, some random synapses in her brain connected in the right order and she said "CONFEDERACY!!!" I was very proud of her, just as you would be proud of a two-year-old who has just announced: "I WENT POO-POO ON THE POTTY!!!!!" What I mean is, you wouldn't be very proud if the average person said that they just took a dookey on the toilet, and you wouldn't be very proud if they knew who fought against the Union in the Civil War I confirmed that the Union was Northern and Free, and that the Confederacy was Southern and Slave We resumed quizzing and she got every question on the worksheet correct This is because she memorizes the questions That way, she can pass the test without actually learning anything You see, if you memorize stuff, you only have to remember that the answer to number 6 is Clara Barton for a week, rather than having to remember that Clara Barton started the Red Cross for the rest of you life I sincerely appologize if anyone is offended by my view of memorization I also would like such persons to immediatly leave my site You don't belong here You see knowledge is good If my sister uh Mrs X were ever asked a question on the Civil War on a quiz show, she'd come up with nothing With knowledge you can win money and the opportunity to look like a dork on national television My sister is a big believer in the memorization system I previous time when I was studying with her (American Revolution, this time) I was trying to help her remember the difference between the Patriots(Patriotic to America) and the Loyalists (Loyal to Britain) She didn't know what the word patriotic meant I tried to explain I asked her how you dress on the forth of july (she said nice) I asked what the colors red, white and blue were (pretty) I gave up in exasperation More recently, I was trying to instill a sense of empathy and niceness in her I asked her what the golden rule of christianity was She didn't know When I pressed her, she confessed she didn't know what chrisianity was Completly defeated, I told her that it was the religion she practiced every Sunday when she went with her friends to church This confirmed my suspicion that she only went so that she could have the use of the church's playground equipment My family also strongly suspects that she stole $20 from the donation thingy Anyway, that's my rant on the new generation that contains my little sister When someone of her generation runs for president, I'm gonna do a complete background check If they're anything like my sister, I'm movin' to Canada Gotta go the Russian-Brittish-Iraqi-enslaved-Africans are coming to defeat the Mexicans I'm back! *there's that darn cricket again* And I have a genuine question to ask all of my loyal readers *cough-cough* Okay, here it is: Is it normal for a non-gender specific sibling to carry around various dead reptiles (snakes, turtles, lizards etc ) Furthormore, is it considered accepted behavior to talk to these dead reptiles, in a cooey, baby talky kind of voice? Finnaly, is it expected for said sibling's non-gender specific parent to encourage such behavior, citing "I was just like that as a child" as an excuse? It's an honest question as I fear that my non-gender specific sibling is weird Who am I kidding? My entire family is weird It's just a matter of degree Hey, by the way I'm sorry that my last few entries have been only about my various family antics Although I can't see why you care, because there is a large probability that you do not exist, because I don't think anyone is reading this anymore How discouraging People need to make the time to waste time It's a time honored tradition Who'd thought that I could use time that many times in only a few sentences? It's been pretty quiet here lately, which is why I haven't added anything to this text in awhile I know, you were just crushed that nothing new was happening It's a sad, cold, cruel world out there and you had nothing to relieve the monotony of it *sniffle* I feel so sorry for you! Next thing you know, you're internet connection will die Well, too bad! Do you know I never even had a computer untill just a few months ago (that's why I'm obsessivly writing here) So I won't pity you if you're computer dies for unexpected reasons Time for another quote from the FLAMING CHICKEN HANDBOOK!!! Code: 843 of the Flaming Chicken Handbook states that in no way is the Patron Saint of Paper Clips (guess who?) responsible for any faulty wiring or lack thereof in your computer The Patron Saint of Paper Clips in no way wishes harm on your computer Any derogatory statement is simply an opinion of an individual, not of the flaming order of the flaming chickens Said order will in no way be held responsible for any damages, injuries, loss of life, limb, head, or organs Okay, quote is done Maybe I should put quotation marks around them nah, too much work But I probably will eventually get around to having a seperate page just for the FLAMING CHICKEN HANDBOOK That way all the members (what members) can print out a copy of it for themselves (if they didn't get that copy in the mail) I guess I'm done for the day I know You want me to stay It's okay Because eventually, I'll be back! Seeya! I'm back And once again suprised When I was at a TAB poetry thingy (TAB is good TAB is great We love TAB) I met some new people One of these people (who shall remain nameless untill such time that I have explicit permission to use her name) turned out to be almost as weird as me As in she read the ENTIRE Longest Text Ever The whole thing So far two whole people (to my knowledge) have read the entire thing, and a few people have skimmed it That means I really can justify claiming to have two and a half readers! I'm so happy! That means my pointless obsession has actually entertained someone besides me! Perhaps, one day, far in the future, this will actually be a world record and random people will acutally voluntarily read this text every day Or maybe not The point is that it is nice to have readers Or maybe it's not I mean won't the quality *snicker* of my work deteriorate if I am no longer writing for the target audience of me? If that happens, then no one will read this And then I'll be writing for me again And then the quality will rise And then people will start reading And then the quality will go down and the vicious spiral of good and bad will continue untill I either give up this text, or go crazy er In any case I should probably find a topic Yeah a topic would be good Or I could just continue to write about finding a topic Ooooo! I know a topic! Ice cream trucks! This has been bothering me for a while You see when it's hot, you want something cold to eat Conviently, ice cream trucks come around during the hottest part of the year (it must be a conspiracy) As you may or may not know, small children swarm the ice cream trucks The vendors even play whimsical music which I strongly suspect contains subliminal messages to make you hungry for ice cream The vendors get oodles of cash, and the kids get ice cream Now, in today's society of buying groceries on-line and getting them delivered, why hasn't any other food industry marketed this ingenius idea to bring the product to the consumer I can just see Hot Dog, and Pizza trucks roaming the neighbor hoods, selling treats to hungry children and adults Of course, said adults would have to peel their butt-cheeks off the couch but they'd have to do that for the delivary man anyway The food trucks could even play music that made you hungry for their food Then the problem with obesity in America would be blamed on evil food truck drivers as opposed to the harmless, benificient television and computer We could all breath a sigh of relief as parents kept their children inside, away from the evil truck drivers and near the T V Gone would be the days when parents told children to play outside, it's a nice day Parents would buy their children computers, video games and other television neccesities This, of course would expand the market for such products This would lead to a better, more stable economy Food industires would be buying cars, gas and music Parents would increase the purchase of entertainment items In return companies would make a profit, pay their workers better The workers would then be able to afford more entertainment items and the upward spiral would continue, as opposed to the evil downward spiral of my writing In conclusion, Ladies and Gentlemen if you implement my idea, there will be peace and prosperity for all As long as you don't mind a few more couch potatoes Gotta go I think I hear a catchy jingle I'm back it's been awhile since I've written here A lot has happened Like my EVIL school computer deleting my updates page But it's all good Especially since I just saw The Matrix: Reloaded The following text may spoil the movie for you, so WARNING: do no read this unless you have already seen the movie Okay What I liked best was the philosophy on choices (the mindless fight scenes were really cool, too) It's like this In the beginning of the movie, Neo is having dreams about Trinity's death Later, The Oracle tells him that he has already decided her fate Towards the end of the movie, Neo chooses to tell Trinity to stay out of the Matrix, since he saw her die in it She agrees, but only after seeing how important it is to him After a horrific chain of events (is it coincidence, or fate) the people who will deactivate the secondary power source of the building Neo is infiltrating, die So the plan is going to fail Unless someone does something, Neo, Morpheus and many others will die Trinity, who is of course outside of the Matrix, knows this and chooses to enter the Matrix to save the day The events of Neo's dream unfold So when the oracle said that the choice had already been made, she was completely correct The moment Neo woke from dreams of Trinity's death, he made a choice He would do everything in his power to keep his dream from becoming reality So he kept her out of the Matrix, and she saw the problem, and entered the Matrix to fix it If she had been in the Matrix, she would have likely been with Morpheus, never would have known about the plan's failure, would therefore not have been in the situation that resulted in her death And the plan would have failed and Neo might have died, along with a large portion of the city (the building was set to blow if there was any intruders) So Neo's choice to attempt to save Trinity triggered the sequence of events that led to her death As Neo realizes all of this, through a nearly omniscient Architect of the Matrix, he makes another choice This choice is simply an extension of his original choice: he will save Trinity at all costs Neo is told that he has two choices He can save mankind, and doom Trinity Or he can try to save Trinity and doom mankind No guarantee that he'll succeed in saving Trinity He goes for Trinity, makes it just in time to catch her body, and starts her heart back up In return for not taking the easy route, he gains a power in the more or less real world He can deactivate the machines, (squidies) but at great personal cost The movie ends with him in a coma Now, you must realize that I have described only one aspect of this movie of all movies There are not enough words in the English language to describe the sheer coolness of the fight choreography, special effects and the plot I highly recommend you see the movie yourself I'm sorry that today's rant isn't random, insane or completely chaotic, but I must right my experience with The Matrix before I forget I am so buying this movie when it comes out on DVD I love it! You have to admit its sheer coolness I mean, come on! It's the sequel to the movie that revolutionized the standard by which we judge special effects I better stop typing before I have a heart attack just remember The Matrix has you I'm back And throughly pissed off at my school system in general You see they feel that the only way to reward academic achievement yada-yada-yada is to force the smart kids to be ushers for Senior Honor Nite, and Graduation Where is the logic in this? I for one, didn't know about such dire consequences for not deliberatly failing classes It was bad enough that I was forced to "volunteer" my precious time (i could have worked on this site) no I was forced to wear formal attire My school system is stuck in the past and formal attire means a dress a white dress (for those you who never bothered to find out I am indeed female) So for the first time in about 5 years I wore a dress and something that was complelty white What cruel fate is this? To compound the EVIL situation I was forced to wear feminine shoes In other words they hurt And they pushed my toes together Since I have a rather weird phobia of touching my own skin this made my evening my own personall torture session I think that such gender-specific torture should be deemed inhumane and abolished from our great society of flaming chickens Henceforth Code: 666 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that under no circumstance will the Patron Saint of Paper Clips (guess who) be forced to wear anything other than a t-shirt and preferably black jeans Should you violate this right, you will become destroyed or possibly dizzy I'm leaving now I have some destruction to do i'm back from graduation we had to get there one hour and fifteen minutes early because there was traffic After standing around a lot the ceremony started Lots of people spoke by the time I had to do my part (tell people where to stand before getting their diploma) it was dark there were bugs they liked landing on me then i got to go stand while people said a lot of stuff i couldn't hear it because someone had put the speakers facing the audience we clapped the whole time, even during the name-calling, seniors were playing with silly string and beachballs afterwards they turned off the lights there were lots of fireworks i wandered around for 20 minutes looking for a cell phone i called home, and waited another hour for my ride traffic to the school was one way i felt sorry for my dad i am tired but cannot go to sleep i'll copy and paste this to my site maybe the longest text ever you will all suffer as i have suffered when and if you graduate i cannot feel my feet i hate dress shoes I'm back Today, I'm here to salute the Pointless Signs Of America! The PSOA have been whole-heartedly working for you, and what have you done for them? NOTHING! These so-called "pointless" signs are doing just what they were meant to do: entertain you! You cannot judge them simply because they have no apparant function They expand your mind, making you think about all the things they could do They could do anything they wanted to, if they just put their minds to it If you judged everything by what it doesn't acomplish, then the entire world is populated by pointless beings Noone can do everything, so how can you expect a SIGN, with the I Q of toilet paper, to do everything You people sicken me You expect far to much of the inanimate world The inanimate world, on the otherhand, expects nothing of you Which is exactly what it gets If you expect nothing, and get nothing, you feel nothing If you expect nothing and get something, you're happy But, if you expect something and get something you feel nothing And if you expect something and get nothing, you feel cheated If you're following along, and not completly confused, you'll realize that it is better to be a pessimist than an optomist Yep that's right This entry went from saluting the PSOA to making a statement about my ideals This has been a weird day You can thank my associate "Meg" she came up with the PSOA acronym Everyone, clap for "Meg" I gotta go seeya later! I'm finnaly back! Today, I took a long look at this site, which is the acomplishment of almost a year of work And I asked myself "How could I have better spent my time?" And so, in the interest of wasting even more time, I made a list Here we go! Number One: I could have cured cancer Not that I know anything about medicine or cancer for that matter But I'm sure that if I just would have put my mind to it, I could have done it Number Two: I could helped the earth to find eternal and lasting peace Which would be boring So I at least have an excuse for not doing that Number Three: I could have studied and stuff Uh don't think so Number Four: I could have learned to drive This would have resulted in the deaths of numerous pedistrians and I would still probably be wondering around in search of a McDonalds Number Five: I could have read more books, played more video games and watched more mindless television Gee I wish I'd thought of that sooner Number Six: I could have implemented one of several plans for world domination Or, as an alternative, I could have ruined several plans for world domination that other people made Number Seven: I could drive people crazy Wait aren't I already doing that? Scratch number seven And on to: Number Eight: I could have uhhhh ummmmm actually thought up these things before hand Number Nine: Now it's just getting redundant, isn't it? Number Ten: This is the list that never ends Yes, it goes on and on my friend One person, started typing it not knowing what it was, and they'll continue typing it forever just because this is the list that never ends, yes it goes on and on my friends, some person started typing it not etc, etc Okay I admit it I have officialy run out of ways I could have better spent my time I don't think there actually are any Except for maybe five and six Now, those have possibilities However, I am currently content to just sit here and type For the benefit of you, the reader who may or may not exist Either way, I'm continuing to sort of entertain myself I feel like I should be outraged about some topic or another I just can't work up the energy to be outraged Perhaps a nice, soothing mistrust Yeah I can work with mistrust I definitly mistrust lots of stuff Like organ grinders, and the evil conspiracies Did you know, that Kodak was part of the conspiracy to assasinate John F Kennedy Now, some of you are probably thinking "Gee, Really?", or "Wow, I never knew that!" while others are thinking "Who's John F Kennedy?" or possibly "Who or What is Kodak" I fervently hope that you're not thinking the last two especially about Kodak Kodak, as you may know, is a film developing company And John F Kennedy (JFK) was an alien bent on global domination Or possibly a really good president who wanted to fly to the moon Either way, he got assasinated And ever loony in America decided that it was a conspiracy Some even go so far as to claim that Kodak "changed" the pictures of the assasination to make an assasination in the bushes become a tree's shadow I didn't know that they had such good technology back then I have to wonder why would Kodak do such a thing Perhaps Kodak is actually a front organization for a shadowy governmental system that controls the entire world and didn't want mankind to obtain the freedom of the stars and so tried to sabotauge the space program even though it didn't work as well as they planned Or perhaps not Either way, Kodak is undeniably evil How can any company that takes so many "wholesome" pictures not be? You can just bet that they look at every one that get's turned in to them, judging blackmail value, and whether or not you could get arrested It's just sickening, you can't even take a simple photo nowadays Unless you have a digital camera, which are a symbol of freedom from the old ways and willing enslavement to the new ways We can only hope that the digital camera manufacturers are kinder masters than the evil Kodak Lords I better go I think Kodak is tracing my site I'm back now! And, once again, I have proof that someone actually took the time (two hours) to read this entire Longest Text Ever! It's amazing, it's incredible, it's unbelievable But true Even more incredible, this time it's someone I don't even know! Wooooooo! I feel inspired and happy and other really good emotions and stuff And so, I'll take a trip down memory lane, to the dark depths of the past, to when I decided to make this page It was inspired, in part, by my sheer and utter boredom In school, back before I even owned a computer, I'd type random words for long periods of time, 'cause I had nothing better to do Once I got this computer, I decided to do something similar on my beloved site But, it ended up making more sense than I anticipated (scary thought, huh) Oh, well I tired of nostalgia Back to the present Right now, I'm just typing so that no one can say that I've been slacking off I don't think I have any conspiracy theories except pop-ups/pop-unders Have you ever had the evil pop-up that says that if you click here, it'll get rid off all the annoying pop-ups? Isn't that sort of ironic? Could the pop-up blocker people have chosen a better means to advertise their product? It's like grand-theft auto 3's talk show, you know, the one where there are Citizens Raging Against Phones? Or CRAP, for short And the lady representing them, calls the radio station on a phone It's stupid and ironic and just shouldn't exist in a better world Pop-Up ad's help you get rid of pop-up ads? Insane, chaotic hmmmmm I wonder who thought of it? Was it on purpose, or was it just some mistake? It is now my civic duty to discover this ancient mystery, and reveal it to the uncaring world Or maybe I'll go make a frozen pizza Yeah That sounds good, too Since I'm not particualarly inspired at the moment, I should leave and let you gather what is left of your sanity I just can't seem to stop, though Okay I can do it I'm leaving I'm back and it's several hours later I've decided to imortalize the stupidity of my dog, Moose She is a heavy-set Yorkshire Terrior (12 lbs ) In otherwords, she's a small yappy dog who is big for her breed Today, I met her arch-enemy An enemy so terrifying that Moose cannot stop shaking An enemy so hideous that Moose must destroy it at all costs An enemy so dangerous that Moose fears it above all others Now you may be wondering what horrible beast is Moose's arch-enemy And you probably suspect that it is something pathetic You would be correct in your suspiciousness for Mooses arch-enemy is *dramatic drumroll* a small, white, feather Now, Moose has seen many feathers, birds even But none have struck terror in her little moose heart like this particular feather So naturally I put her arch-enemy in my pocket and brought it home with me This action has made her very suspicious of where my loyalties lie She tracks the feather smell all over the house, and goes crazy whenever I take it out of my pocket She even got her sister and mother in the spirt of things Now her sister sounds an alarm whenever she sees the evil feather Now, you may be wondering what is so terrifying about a small, white, feather So am I It doesn't smell funny, (I asked my brother, since I don't have a sense of smell), it seems perfectly ordinary So, I've decided that Moose works for some secret government organization, and that the feather is the key to the destruction of the world, and I am just blithely letting it enter our home, so that it may furthur its evil plans to destroy the universe That is the only possible explanation as to why it upsets her so much Or maybe it's the feather off of the cartoon owl from the tootsie-roll pop comercials (one two three *crunch*) Whatever the case, I decided that the whole world, (or three of four random people) deserve to know that if the world and or universe are destroyed, it's the evil, little, white, feather's fault Now I'd better go and torture my Moose with it :) I am officially back And you, the potentially non-existant reader gets a once in a lifetime chance to hear me rant and rave about my Horrible, Horrible Family Vacation I know You feel very, very honored It's like this My mother is a control freak, and she decided on the spur of the moment that we were going north to visit relatives Later that day, she decided we were NOT going north, we were going south to a beach resort Still later that day, she got offended at some trivial thing and decided that we weren't going anywhere at all The very next day, she decided that we were going north, after all So, we packed everthing up Before we knew it, we were on the road The first part of the trip was fairly easy As in, I was half-asleep, hoping that we'd arrive while I slept Then, in an inspired move, my brother talked my mother into letting him sit up front That meant that my mother would be in the back, with me and my younger, eviler sister Immediatly, my mother started complaining It was uncomfortable in the back, it was too hot, it was too cold Then, she accidently woke our three yappy dogs up, and they relized that they were in a car That meant only one corse of action for them They started shaking and barked their little heads off This annoyed my mother further, untill she asked, no, demanded that my father turn the car around so that we could go home Unfortuantly, we had already driven 337 miles toward our destination After much argument, my father was going to turn around, untill he realized that my mother was going to drop the dogs and me off, and then turn around and continue north This seemed slightly unpracticle, so we ended up not taking that 337 mile detour We eventually reached our destination after 16 hours of virtually non-stop driving We got there, we ate We slept My mother visited relatives And so the week went by I got to go to a huge library, and see Terminator 3 at the local theater That was the high point of the entire trip The last day, we were deciding where to eat My mom said that she didn't care So my dad picked a steak place My mother tried to order a mushroom-swiss burger only to discover that the place had no swiss-cheese So she decided on a salad, only to discover that they didn't have her favorite salad dressing After much deliberation, she decided that she wouldn't eat After complaining how hungry she was, and about the poor quality of the resteraunt, she walked out of the resteraunt, instructing the rest of us to "enjoy our meals" And I wonder where my little sister gets her annoyingness Not that my mother is annoying just set in her ways The whole meal thing was about the only interesting thing to happen during the week On the way home, we had gotten approximatly 4 hours into the trip when my mother predicatably decided that we had to go back and eat at the 50th aniversary of her favorite ice cream place Needless to say, we ignored her Oh, and when my sister had to go to the bathroom very badly during a traffic jam, my mother had the good taste to making hissing/water noises to make my sister's problem worse She claimed that my little sister always did it to her, and she was getting pay-back Between her bickering with my sister, and obsessivly playing neopets games, I don't know what to do with her Anyway that was my family vacation rant It sucked No suprise At least it's over Sorry if I complained a lot If you don't like it, start your own longest text ever Anyway, I promise to go back to my usual routine the next time I rant here I thought of a topic on the way home, but forgot it Seeya I'm back! I know, I took you completly by suprise You thought you'd gotten rid of me *cheesy super-hero voice* Well, fear not, random citizen, for I, PSOPC am here! *normal voice* Today I have a very important to discuss with you in this: PERFECTLY NORMAL PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCMENT Yes, that's right It's time to warn you, the viewer er reader about the evils of various stuff Today's lesson is: subliminal messages That's right, folks, mass hypnosis via commercials Now, I'm sure you've at least heard of subliminal messages , right? No? Well prepare to be enlightened Subliminal messages are an advertising technique that puts hidden pictures and words into a main image You don't see them, but your subconsious (dreaming) mind does Your subconsious mind acts on whatever it is told What does this mean to you? It means that WAL-MART TV IS EVIL! EVIIIIIIIIIIIIL!!!!!! Why else would they invest all that money to show commercials in their own store? Because they put subliminal messages in them, of course! Subliminal messanging also explains the successes of certain fast-food resteraunts, and brand name items BEWARE YOUR TOASTER OVEN! Okay That had nothing to do whatsoever with subliminal messages it's just cool to say Anyway, only watch wal-mart if you WANT to be subliminaly entertained into purchasing a new set of TUPERWARE, even though your old set is PERFECTLY fine This has been a public service announcment Pretty cool, huh? Uh you don't have to take the subliminal stuff seriously It's true, and all, but I have no proof about wal-mart, or certain fast food resteraunts It makes sense, though Wal-mart TV is evil You cannot deny it Seeya hmmm I wonder if there's subliminal stuff in my computer I'm back And I feel that it's time for a FAKE commercial break, for the highly informed, obviously brain-dead consumer And now, a word from our non-existant sponsor Ketchup: The only food that you'll want to eat after traveling to the 5th Dimension It's been practically proven that Ketchup transforms into a highly intoxicating (non-addictive) delicious substance upon returning from the 5th Dimension Stock up now with our Valu-Pak to recieve 3-metric tons of Ketchup, all for the low, low price of your brain, since you're obviously not using it anyway Then, just wait for technology to "catch-up" (get it, catch-up, Ketchup?)so you can travel to the 5th Dimension like our scientists almost did (Next Commercial) Get ready fo: Faux's new "reality" TV show, "How Low Can We Go?" It's about six contestants who compete to create the worst, least likely "reality" TV show The winner not only gets the million-dollar prize, they get the chance to produce the show they created Remember: if the show sucks, it's their fault, not ours!(Next exciting commercial!)And for all the idiots out there: Try new and improved Dum-B-Gon!

I bet you wanna go eat some Ketchup covered Dum-B Gon right now, while watching "reality" TV Just make sure you "spray" your food first Pathetic, wasn't it? Oh, well I was bored, and a dilligent reader suggested I make fake commercials, so therer they are Happy? Good I'm leavin', for now I'm back And I'm willing to enlighten you, the potentially you-know-what reader Today, I was checking out some weird news At one point, I read an article that stated that it had been proven, conclusivly, that Kansas was flatter than the standard pancake The researches even used highly advanced technololgy to map the surface of a pancake and compare it to documented geology of Kansas Some people disagree, the director of the Kansas Geological Survey said "I think this is part of a vast breakfast food conspiracy to denigrate Kansas It's a cheap shot " So doesn't that make you want to take Kansas' side (I sincerly appologize if you are from Kansas) It just seems extremly weird (and worthy of mentioning) that this semi-important guy from Kansas believes in a "vast breakfast food conspiracy" Makes you think that the long held belief that Kodak conspired with the JFK assasin(s) is normal Another article claims that an anitseptic turned a polar bear purple, drawing large crowds of people I sure hope other zoos won't copy them Before you know it, we'll have orange alligators, pink tigers and blue lions School children won't be able to correctly identify the color of a zebra Random people will think they've gone crazy, after a seemingly innocent visit to the zoo It's wrong, I tell you A complete and total degregation of our societies values What values, you say? The basic moral belief that Polar bears should be WHITE Unless we spray-painted the snow purple, too Then it would be okay As long as the bear blends in, you know? Speaking of animals, there's a cat in California who is a kleptomaniac (likes to steal stuff) He sneaks into neighboring homes, and takes clothing, wrapped christmas presents, and anything he can find He then leaves them under his owners car Okay, better leave I'm back And I don't really have a topic today I'm just bored Sometimes I just do this, you know? Start typing without any idea about what it is I intend to say Maybe I subconsiously DO know what I'm doing here, but refuse to admit it to myself Or maybe I am monumentally bored and don't have anything else to do at the moment Either way, I'm here You must be pretty bored, too Otherwise, why on earth (beta, krpto, zkdjf, Planet X, whatever) would you be here? It would make no sense If you have something better to do, why wouldn't you be doing it right now? I would be But, maybe that's just the difference between you and me Yeah That must be it Unless you're bored Then I completly understand I need to find a topic Here, topic, topic, topic! Come on, I won't hurt you, I promise! *hides large ax behind back* Come here, topic! Why are you afraid of little ol' me? *sigh* There are no topics anywhere near me Kinda like me and "Meg" webcomic we are trying to do It's called Hit-Or-Miss, any topics, plot, etc are completly accidental and are not the fault/responsibility of the creators That was sort of a topic, even though it was sort of random Which is what I do best Okay, I'm done with that litte commercial What now hmmmmm should I share with you more of my paranoid/delusional conspiracy theories? Or have I been doing that too much lately? Oooooo! I know, I'll start of list of why it's fun/good to be insane/weird! #1You can say or do anything and normal people will agree with you in the hopes that you'll be satisfied, shut up, and go away Far away I will show you an example with this completly true stuff that I experienced several years ago ME: My vicious, psychotic, flesh-eating bunny-rabbit wants to rule the world RANDOM PERSON: Uh-huh, that's nice ME: Yeah, but I told her that she'd be a terible ruler I mean, she traded Asia for a carrot! And she doesn't even LIKE carrots! RANDOM PERSON: You don't say? ME: Yep She also is the goddess of red jello RANDOM PERSON: *head explouding from sheer insanity* As you can see, I was a very weird child (this happened in elementary school uh except for that head-explouding part) Okay on to: #2 You can get out of practically anything by saying: a)It's against my religion b)I'm allergic to that c)I have an extremly irrational fear of that d)I already did that in a past life and it sucked e)My psychotic bunny predicted I'd die doing it Unfortunalty, several of those reasons LEGITAMITLY apply to a certain activity I do every Tuesday, which WILL NOT BE NAMED HERE LEST I GIVE IT POWER OVER ME! I'm allergic to parts of it, have irrational fears about others and I'm pretty sure it's against my Jenny religion along with eating mashed potatoes, or potatoes of any kind I'll add that to the FLAMING CHICKENS HANDBOOK Thou shalt not eat spuds Hmmmm time for #3You can obsessive over ANYTHING, and people will think nothing of it I, personally, am obsessed with, kitties, bunnies, bats, this website, drawing, making intriate little patterns with strings, doing mildly repetitive activities, being weird, apparantly making lists and cheese and chickens and flame Fire is good Fire is free Fire is my friend until it burns me Then it must die painfully And on to:#4You make your friends look normal in comparison And #5: You can give each of your pets several weird names such as: Ringling-Raison-Bailey-Suzana-Midnight-Schultz, Squirell, Moose, Moose-Moose, Moosey-Moose, Linzey-Moose, Muffin, Squirell-Muffin, Yabby-Doodle, Abby Normal, Wiggle-Baby, Wiggle-Muffin, Witle-Baby, Cheese-Monkey, Muffin-With-Squirell-Juice, Squirell-With-Muffin Juice, Moosey-Juice, Squirell-Monkey, etc Now, wasn't that a fun list!? Doesn't that just make you proud to be weird? I should make bumber stickers saying that Proud to be weird It'd be cool Anyway, gotta go! *yawn* I'm back Last night I was super-charged with lots of sugar and not a lot of sleep I ended up writing things during the time of night when EVERYTHING is hilarious, including the word sheep To compound things, I wasn't alone, and things just escalated The following is everything I wrote during that sugar-coated time period Some are answers to e-mails, the rest are just stuff I wrote Definitly THen we go to library Guess what? Me and Josh ate lots and lots of sugar, and it's late at nite and everything is funny but we can't laugh 'cause everybody is sleepin' so it's even funnier but ever since we drank the water we sobered up even though we weren't drunk but we ate sugar lots and lots of sugar MOstly donut cake Okay JOsh says it was only one piece of cake WE got it at Wal-mart Or his mom did OR something Goodbye oh, and the fresh chicken wings might be to blame they were special wings I hope I remember doing this I think it's pretty funny > You have blue hari *gigles* I like hair Josh says I probably won't remember writing any of this, but I can't sleep THe cake was good aSk anybody Big Brother may be listening right now so I beter go They're listening for a secrret no it's cause of a secret But the secret doesn't exist so they are stupid *g8ggles* bye Yes Megan has hair I've seen it *giggling* It's very, very late at nite ONly not really i like sugar NO, wait It's early WE have been having very profound thoughts lately We think THey might havve been important, but we keep forgetting them We're not sure Josh wants his thought back *sniffle* i do, too It's not fair I think mine involved a jaunty song to sing But I couldn't have sung it 'cause it would have woken everyone up and they would have called me inconsiderate I have to get up really early to leave for home I should be asleep *gigles* It milght have been a sugar rush 'cause now we're having a sugar crash OR, maybe it's the writing Okay, maybe it was the ranch dressing instead of the special, fresh buffalo wings But they really were'nt buffoal wings 'cause buffalo's don't have wings cause they come off when they are babies, JOsh says so and he must be right causse he's been having Profound Thoughts even though he cannot remember them But, the wings were'nt really special I don't think Maybe we're just really, really tired and had sugar I don't want to play the stupid animal war card game 'cause the stupdi bear gets eaten by an eaagle As you can see, I was in a very interesting state of mind I hadn't had a genuine sugar rush since I was 11 It was fairly fun Although I acted like an idiot Oh, well I have more stuff to write, but I gotta go right now Stay tuned to hear my thoughts on tanning, and an evil card game, and who knows what else Okay I'm back Here's what I wrote this weekend: Woooooo! 5000 hits! Aren't I special? *sigh* I can't think of anything to write But I must I must defeat the sister site of the Longest Text Ever! I mean, I've been doing this much, much longer than the other person Hmmmmm monkey Why do weird people (myself included) obsess about monkeys? And, are monkeys spelled monkies? It just looks weird Like a division of mounties made entirely out of monks I bet it's spelled monkeys It looks right Maybe I should use spell-check But that'd be a lot of work, unlike ranting, raving and rambling Hey, it's the 3 r's! No longer does school teach use reading, riting and 'rithmitic, it now teaches us ranting, raving and rambling! (and redundancy!) After all, isn't that basicly what the best teachers do? It sets a perfect example for you young, impressionable minds Those are the best kind *yet another highly dramatic, time-consuming sigh* I need a topic A good one Not one of those bargain ones anyone can find at your local topic discount outlet store I'll rant and rave and ramble about the EVILS of sunlight Most people actually like to spend long periods of time exposing their vulnerable skin to the harmful rays of the sun These people have obviously suffered major brain damage from their prolonged exposure to the sun The actually think that their skin's efforts to protect them are ATTRACTIVE It'd be like someone thinking that scabs are atractive, 'case they protect you from disease Then everyone would cut and scrape themselves to be covered in scabs That's exactly what tanning is like Purposly damaging the skin so you can look "attractive" Now, a long time ago, people were sort of smarter They avoided the sun at all costs They associated tans with hard, manuel labor Then, some fasion bimbo went on a fasionable safarii to get some fasionable furs, or whatever When she came back, 'lo and behold, she had a tan This resourceful young vanguard of fasion decided to cover her extreme embarassment by acting like she meant to horribly damage herself And because she was the head fasion bimbo, everyone agreed that the look was definitly "in" So, everyone went to the beach and got tans Girls began wearing skimpier, and skimpier bathing suits Men, of course, had no complaints (Though whether it was the tan or the skimpy suits, no one will ever know ) As you read this Historicly Accurate Anecdote, you must realize the parallel between it and the fable The Emperoro's New Clothes Someone did something incredbly stupid, but because they were powerful, everone acted like it was a stroke of genius And the preceding generations became brain-washed (possibly through subliminal messages in sun-tan lotion commercials) to believe tans were expected Those few who actually could think and avoided the sun were considered to be outcasts I don't mean to insult you if you DO have a tan I am simply explaining why I, personally, refuse to swim, go to the beach, sunbathe, leave the house, etc Alrighty then I'm gonna quit for now I'm back I'm so very, very tired School has been on for four days now I have three very hard academic classes They give lots and lots of homework Two and a half hours of homework (total) to be precise I get home from work at 5:30p m and eat dinner Then I do my homework I get done at 9:15 Then I wait for my mom and dad to stop playing Collapse II so that I can get on I usually have less than 30 minutes It sucks I can't really work on this site even though I now have a more in depth understanding of variables I learned this from my calculator I made a virtual pet for it It was fun I'm tired Did I mention that, yet My calculator is nifty Sometimes, it is lazy It tells me stuff like: "Warning: More Solutions May Exist" and "Questionable Accuracy" So it doesn't bother to find all solutions, and it may be wrong Geee that is comforting I love my calculator, though It does all my Math for me I hate Math Math is so picky In English, and stuff, if you miss one little detail, at most you lose partial credit, but you usually get it all right In Math, one teeny, tiny little mistake will make you get the entire thing wrong I tend to make those tiny mistakes, and get bad grades, even if I understand the concepts I hate Math I'm tired Are you tired I sure am Guess what I wanna do How did you ever guess? That's right, I wanna sleep Why can't I? Hmmmm good question I think I'm so tired I can't sleep Plus I gots oblimagations obligaton obligations to this site yeah thats it i so tired bye-bye I'm back And more than slightly embarassed Today my frazzled-brain produced something that is decidedly Jenny (that's my more or less "real" name) I was contemplating how my heavy load of books made me like a bulldozer and than I was about to suggest to my friend, "Meg" that we invent one Then I realized that the buldozer already HAD been invented That's how I knew it's name, picture and what it did That is just pathetic School is taking its toll *sigh* *sniffle* *snort* *insert word that is a sound that begins with an "s" here* I don't have much time, so, I must be brief I'm not sure how I CAN be brief since I have absolutly nothing to say The best way to be brief is to quit now Right now Which is what I'm about to do Any miniute now I promise Okay Bye! *sigh* My dogs are just weird You remember my Moose's arch-enemy, don't you? You know, the small, white feather Well, my squirell now has an arch-enemy At least her's makes sense sort of Her enemy is a fake Yorkshire Terrior (same species as her) made entirely out of goat hair She HATES and FEARS it She'll shake and run from it, then suddenly dive and bite it's head She goes crazy if someone holds it, 'cause it's getting attention and not her I'm fairly certain she knows it's not alive, though Maybe she just doesn't like goat-smell In any case, she is clearly insane Just like everyone else in my family In other news, I participated in the Second Battle of the Asparagus Wars and chronicled them here I'll add a link to the main page when I get around to it It gave me new insight into how weird I am I fought with vegitables, covered myself in bubble wrap, groveled before the Great Banana and dodge skittles and flying doughnuts and rubber chikens The entire message board was like one big insane asylum Needless to say, I felt right at home Well, seeya *waves brightly* I got to go to my Grendel (really cool book) project for school I's making fake soundtracks like the teacher told me! BYE!!! Okay I'm back Today's rant is a panic rant There are not going to be conspiracies or humor of any kind I think *let the panic begin!* IT'S NOT FAIR! Why do I have to work year round? I only signed up for a semester I was looking forward to having A elective, while everyone else was enjoying three or four or even more Oooo I'm a poet, and don't I know it? In any case it's awful It's bad enough to go to school, leave school, go to work, leave work, do homework and then wait for my dad to get off of the computer so that I can do stuff I want SOME free time That's all Is that too much to ask? I spend from 8-5 doing what everyone else wants When is it MYturn? Next semester will be almost exactly like this one Even though my schedule is technically supposed to be completly differnt You see, my school has "block" scheduling That means I take four classes this semester and four different classes next year But one of my classes is work, and two others are horrible year-round classes So next semester I'll still have work, AP Lit, and AP Physics It's not FAIR Physics is so FREAKIN' hard! I don't understand it I have no problem with Lit Okay Work I love my work, I love the kids I work with But I HATE spending three hours of every day in a "class" when everyone else's class is only an hour and a half I don't care if I have to ride the bus home if I stop work I don't care if I'd get home only an hour or so before I normaly do I want an elective Maybe I think All I know is that I've been assuming one thing while the person in charge has been assuming a completly different thing Neither of us thought to question the other And so I'm in deep doo-doo *sniffle* I just want to have some FREAKIN' variety in my daily grind, you know? I don't WANT to do the same thing for an entire year Yeah, I know, regular schedule schools do that I pity them, I really do I've spent the past three years of my life EXPECTING each semester to be like a mini-year I DO NOT LIKE CHANGE! This is just way too much of a change at once I don't want year-round classes I don't want a full year of work I don't want to be in this mess I'm going to bed I'm back I don't have much of a choice about the whole work thing Plus, the kids at the daycare (where I work, obviously) say that I'm "cool to talk to" That makes me feel alll warm and fuzzy inside Like a muffin They just like how I know lots of pointless laws and random facts Okay ON TO THE CONPIRACY OF THE DAY!: I've had this nagging fear that I am part of some random but vast conspiracy (about what I'm not sure but it must be vast) Meanwhile there is a vast conspiracy at school to keep me ignorant about my pawn roll in the other vast conpiracy by keeping me vastly bored (In a very vast sense) And: did you ever notice that the word "conspiracy" is vastly similar to the word "constipation" I only mention this 'cause I've accidently spelled constipation instead of conspiracy a few times (on accident, vast number of times) Hee-Hee! Isn't vast a funny word? You can just picture sterotypical pirates saying, "A vast ye mateys!" I'm not exactly sure what that means, but it sure is funny:) You don't agree? Shame on you! Code: 888 of The Flaming Chickens Handbook states that The Patron Saint of Paperclips (still me) is always right ALWAYS If the facts beg to differ, than the facts are wrong End of story Seeya I'm back I've been playing one of the new neopets slot machines (black pawkeet) I'm completly and totally addicted Gambling is so much fun! I've won 500 np, at least and I'm on a roll Now sure, I could have won more than 500 at some game in which you don't have to pay to play But, what would be the fun in that? I even came up with a mathematical explanation for why gambling is fun (while I was eating a hyper-speed dinner, thinking nothing of getting back to the slot machine) Okay If you don't understand the concept of numbers less than zero, (negative numbers) just skip this part Imagine a number line that points in the positive and negative direction When I start playing a game, I am on 0 I have neither won nor lost money/neopoints When I win 500np on a normal game, I move to the 500 point There is exactly 500 units of distance between the two extremes of winning amounts (0 and 500) BUT! When I play a gambling game, there is a possibility that I'll lose everything, so I start on negative however much NP I have with me If I had 500np with me, I'd be at-500 Then, when I win 500 additional np, I move to the 500np point The distance between the two extremes of how much I could have won is 1000np, making me feel like I've won much more than if I'd played a normal game Did you understand that? Good I probably won't later But that is irrelevant Goodbye! I am back And I hava a very, almost special rant for you The previous sentence made absolutly no sense Good for it In a recent article, humorist Dave Barry discussed the addictive quality of the snack food, Cheez-Its Naturally, I had many mixed feelings, primarily disgust, as I have not voluntarily eaten a Cheez-It in quite some time They're disgusting, bland and definitly not made of cheez, whatever that is My family has always bought Cheez-Its, to the point of making me physically sick at the thought of eating one (To this day, however, I will almost literally kill for a box of Cheez-It party mix, as it is a rare commodity at my house ) Fortunatly, my mom recently finnaly switched our snack food preference To Cheese Nips Say it Out loud What does it sound like? When you look at them they are identical to the evil little Cheez-Its The only difference is the taste, which I enjoy, since it is new and different What I want to know is this: are there no intelectual property rights in the world of food products? I mean, don't you think the creators of Cheese-Nips had a box of Cheez-Its out when they were designing their product? It seems like blaggerent plagerism The only reason the makers of Cheese-Nips don't get sued is because of the tast difference and Cheese Nips are made of real "cheese" rather than cheez It makes you think of Name-Brand vs Generic cereal brands They are the samething, with the same look, and almost same name But people buy name brands Why, because they assume it's better quality Plus, boxes are more convient than bags A profound statement, if I ever heard one Any way, I'm leaving to eat some Cheessy goodness! I'm back Apparantly my standards of weird have gone up This morning, my Mom came home from work She was upset, because she had accidently run over an armidillo She said she hurt it the first time, and wanted to put it out of it's misery, so she went back and ran over it 11 more times But it's legs were still moving and it was alive She was extremly upset When I related this story to my friends (including "Meg") they thought it was hilarious They couldn't stop laughing I thought it was sad and normal They particularly liked how I said that she went back and ran over it 11 more times I'm not sure why Of course, when I next saw my Mom, she retold the story to me, several times With the exact same words, motions and emotions She didn't think it was weird, either Perhaps my family is just so weird, we've lost all sense of perspective Or maybe it's everybody else that's weird I just don't know What do you think, Hypothetical Reader? You don't know either? Hmmmmm what is this world coming to? Oh, by the way, I was paid a decent compliment today One of my friends (who laughed at the armidillo story) named Tonileigh said "Jenny (that's me) is weirder than the average Psycho " and " You think Jenny's weird? Wait till you see her in angry mob form!" Now THAT'S just weird "angry mob form"? That just sounds nifty! I can clone myself and form and angry mob? In anycase, this was particularly funny because Tonileigh is one of my "normaler" friends Although I tell you she can't possibly be normal, since she hangs out with me Anyway, I'm gonna go I gots stuff to do! I'm back If you'll look toward the bottom of this page, you'll notice that I added a nifty little thing called the "babel fish" It will translate any thing, to anything else Ain't it nifty? What's really fun is to translate an English saying, like out of sight, out of mind Then, when it's in German, or whatever, translate it back to English It's so completly garbled, it's funny For instance, I wrote: "I am the Crazy Taco!", and translated it to German I then copied and pasted the German and put it in the text box I translated it from German to English and got "I am the Moved Taco!" See? Hours of completly useless fun! This has been my hourly Public Service Announcement that I only do when I feel like it Seeya! I'm back! Woooo! And do I ever have a topic today! I've been a paranoid, conspiracy seeking mood lately and the newest threat to my sanity is: smoke detectors! Come on, think about it! In all those 911 shows, people wake up and their house is engulfed in flames The smoke detector either never went off, or went off and the people just slept through it Okay, fire is loud And hot and smoky If you can sleep through a raging fire, close enough to set off the smoke detector, then you are definitly going to sleep through the smoke detector Plus, the fire gradually gets louder, and hotter, and smokier The sleeping person will gradually get used to it (and incorporate it into their dreams) By the time the smoke dector goes off, the fire has drowned it out to no more than an annoying buzz My point is that smoke detectors have very little value in home security Okay, one day, in the future, smoke dectectors will probably activate litte fire-fighter bots that every home will have But untill that day, the concept of the smoke detector is useless If you're awake to hear it, chances are that you've already noticed the smoke, fire and eminent danger If you're asleep, the fire will wake you So, that leads us to the evil paranoid conspiracy I thought of the other night What if the smoke detectors have tiny litte cameras in them? That would explain that annoying green little blinkie light in them Unless, of course, the government was smart enough to have cameras without the blinkie light In any case, wouldn't the blinkie light help night-vision cameras see in the dark? It only takes a little light to help those thingies, and smoke detectors provide more than a little I can even see the shadow of my hand on the wall from the light those things shed It's annoying Here I am, trying to get a decent nights sleep and there's this green light that periodically blinks to red directly in front of me It's a small light, but it's sooooooo annoying There MUST be some sort of conspiracy involved, 'cause if there is, I can get rid of the EVIL thing! So, fellow conspiracy nuts: Take down the evil governmental safety device and take it apart If you can still think during all that incessent beeping, you'll probably find evidence that I'm really paranoid Or possibly right that would be scary In any case I guess that smoke detectors are a neccesary evil but WHY DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE THAT STUPID LIGHT? Does it serve an obvious purpose? No! That's why it MUST be EVIL! You cannot deny the logic of my thinking! Now I'm gonna go and worry about the light on my toaster oven seeya! *sighs dramatically* I'm back It's not fair, ya know? Each Friday, I wait (all tingly with anticipation) for the weekend so that I can stay up 'till the wee hours of the morning and sleep past noon But my idiotic body has an automatic alarm clock, or something During the weekdays, I get about seven hours of sleep (usually less) and wake up at 6:11 a m Yep Now, some of you are probably calling me a whiner, 'cause you have to get up at 4:30, or whatever And lots of you are probably gloating 'cause you don't have to get up 'till 8:30 The reason I have to get up at 6 something is that I I I ride the bus to school Yeah I know pathetic (Believe me, though, you never want to see me drive I get easily distracted by clouds and signs saying FREE KITTIES! kitties are hugable but if you hug them they'll scratch your eyes out so then you have to hiss at them and establish dominence but kitties don't like that even though dogs do but kitties are obviously not dogs even though they are fuzzy ) So my lack of a car and driving skills force me to use the bus, which comes for me 45 minutes before my school even starts It's stupid It only takes me a few minutes to get ready, then I can go back to bed Now I bet you're wondering why I don't just wake up a few minutes before I have to go My sister My evil, EVIL sister That's why She's evil SHE has to get up at 6:11 to put on make-up, do her hair and basically annoy the heck out of me So rather than battle her over the concept of getting dressed in the dark, I get up Oh I'm rambling again, aren't I? Back to the original topic! So when the weekend rolls around, I'm fairly exhausted But, my stupid internal alarm clock is starting to wake me up around six I can usually fall back asleep (if I don't panic and think I'm late for school), but the stupid thing wakes me up again exactly seven hours after I originally fell asleep Which is why it's not even 10:00 and here I am, typing Which I suppose may be a good thing, seeing as how I'm currently in a Longest Text Ever Rivalry with Galaxy Dreamer's site *cough*She's winning*cough* But that's just because I have so much to do to mantain and update this site, I rarely get a chance to just sit here and type Oh, and I would like to mention to my *snicker* LOYAL fans that this Longest Text Ever DOES get updated at least once a week, so please, please, please, PLEASE do not read this once, in one sitting and then leave forever, and ever and ever! It makes me sad *sniffle* Well I feel better now Did you know that I now possess a DOMAIN NAME? Yep That's right! It'll be ready soon, ain't it great? Okay, back to the flaming-chickens LTE rivalry Another reason why this isn't as long as Galaxy's is that I refuse to write every day as it would--this is the funny part--LOWER THE QUALITY OF MY OVERALL WORK! HA-HA! HILARIOUS! "lower the quality"? Sometimes I crack myself up If this was quality work, I'd publish it and make a fortune Speaking of publishing, I do plan on somehow, someday publishing this as the first rambling narrative that makes no sense, and is about as interesting as rereading the almanac I'd probably lose money, but the concept is interesting I think Anyway, I better go or the quality of this will go down in that evil downward spiral thing I discussed a few months back Seeya I'm back Wooooo! I's can get to my site again! It was down for a whole day or so 'cause of all the traffic I got from my new quizes I have an extra-special rant for you all today, to celebrate the new domain name! www flaming-chickens com! Okay I am now barophobic (afraid of gravity) I recently learned in my EVIL Physics class that on average, humans lose one inch of height during the day due to gravity pushing on their spine The height is regained at night, when you're laying down This naturally alarmed the HECK out of me! GRAVITY IS EVIL! It's pushing down on me, squishing my spine MY SPINE IS SQUISHY! That's is just so extremly creepy What if, eventually, Earth's gravity get's very very strong, and we all imploud from the squishyness? It'd be like when you go to the bottom of the ocean, only with gravity instead of pressure *shudders* Pressure is evil, too Air pressure Did you know that there is over two miles of air sitting on you right now? Even though air is light, that much air adds up TWO MILES? Even the air is conspiring to squish me! If you don't believe that all that air has weight, try going into space sometime Space is notorious for not having air When you're in space (without a space suit) you don't SUFFUCATE, you don't FREEZE You exploud Since all that nifty air isn't pressin' on you, your guts and stuff are free to go wherever they want, and the EVIL little things decide to roam around Outside your body It's creepy So air pressure can be a good thing Even though it gains pleasure from squishing my spine That's it, I'm gonna take drastic measures! I'm gonna launch THE OFFICIAL FLAMING CHICKENS LUNAR COLONY! The moon has one-sixth of Earth's gravity And absolutly NO air-pressure We can all wear spiffy space-suits and feel all superiour to all those stupid earthlings So if you wish to contribute to this great and magneficent and magestic and MOOSEY project we need the following things: 739 rolls of aluminium foil (preferably the extra shiny kind) 417 refridgerator boxes, 9000 rolls of "sticky on both sides" duct tape, 300 lbs of chicken feathers (preferably white) and 1 (one) thermo-nuclear-rocket-thruster If you can spare any of these items, please e-mail them to me Yes E-mail Did you really think I'd give you guys my ADDRESS? Now I know what you guys are thinking some of those items on that list are gonna be hard to find Especially that duct tape But, believe me, it's MUCH more practical than the alternative What is the alternative, you ask? I'll tell you Making me(The Patron Saint of Paperclips) the Ruler of the Laws of Nature! That way I can just outlaw the need for gravity and air pressure! I'm already half way there, since I conclusivly proved (in Physics class) that gravity actually causes things to slow down and EVENTUALLY GO UP! Sure, my TEACHER said that was because I was doing the problems wrong, but once I'm the Ruler of the Laws of Nature, I'll change the problems so that I'm right! Oooo! I thought of another very good reason to assist with the Official Flaming Chickens Lunar Colony! As we all know, the world is going to end in about 380,695 days! This means that we only have a very short while to prepare And I sugest that we build the rocket so that we can go to the Official Flaming Chickens Lunar Colony so that we can laugh at the stupid earthlings who are blowing up because they didn't listen to us when we tried to warn them about the impending doom! Once we are on our Lunar Landing Site, we will engage in many exciting activites, primarily related to suffucating and starving If (and this is a big if) the world DOES survive, we can beg them for food, oxygen and other supplies They'll probably just call us weird and laugh at us, but that's beside the point! I can even see the Official Flaming Chicken Rocket It'll be covered in chicken feathers, and shaped like a chicken The foil will make up the beak and the folded legs, and the thruster can simulate the tail It will be a truly magestic site, as it launches from the earth, spewing excess oxygen, cardboard, feathers and tape But, act now, or it will be too late, and you will be one of the losers that we'll be laughing at, assuming we have air to laugh with Remember, e-mail psopc@flaming-chickens com the much needed supplies if that is possible If not, then some day, when the Internet is down and I'm really bored, I will construct a model OFCR and attempt to launch it That will be a wonderous day I think I'll get my little sister to be the test piolet Well better go I need to plan this out more I'm back And mildly weirded-out My dad was on this site My dad It even SOUNDS weird He took the TAB member quiz and turned out to be me, he took the JOB quiz, and was a repo man (which had a pic of my brother) He said he wanted to see what I was doing, and to make sure that I wasn't saying anything derrogatory about my parents He looked me upvia yahoo's search engine using flaming-chicken as the keyword It took him to my quiz page So he probably didn't see the majority of my site It's just weird All along, my entire family has scoffed (nifty word, isn't it?) about my site, and called me weird I dunno I guess I'm just kinda freaked out Oh, and don't forget to celebrate Mad Hatter Day on October the 6th Seeya I'm back I had some conspriacy or another to rant about But then I listened to some of the new music I put on my site and mellowed out I can't remember what I was gonna rant about Oh, yeah Now I do "Purified" water Just wait a sec while I stop the music *content sigh* There we go that's much better Now I can think That's right, folks "Purified" water Now just stop a second and contemplate that Pure means, well, no extra stuff 100% of something Right? Well, next time you buy your $3 FREAKIN' dollar bottle of water, consider this On almost all the "purified" water bottles I've ever seen it has the following mesage: "Purified through reverse osmosis Minerals added for a pure, fresh taste " In other words, they take all that extra "stuff" out to make it pure Then they add other "stuff" in to make it TASTE pure But it's not For all you, the uninformed consumer, could know, it might have rat poison in it "Pure" water manufactuerers are not required to list the ingredients of water, because the average consumer believes that it should be obvious But that is false! They add random minerals to our water to make it taste better, and then advertise it as pure! It's an outrage! I'd rather drink the "impure" tap water where at least I KNOW that someone, somewhere tested it It's a law, I think But does anyone test "pure" water? Most likely they test it BEFORE they add the extra stuff "Yep, Bob, this is some mighty pure water " "Yep, Bill, time to dump the arsnic in so it tastes pure!" What kind of reasoning is that? Wouldn't pure water TASTE pure, and impure water TASTE impure? The insanity and stupidity is mind boggling! That's why I like fast-food salt It actually lists what random minerals they through in to make it TASTE like salt There's salt, of course, and aluminum sulfate, and other compounds But the point is, if I were, say, freakily allergic to a random mineral, I could read the ingredients and not eat the salt That's what they need to do with the water Or, at the very least, not label it as "pure" Okay That's the rant of the week, month, year, whatever I'll probably have another one soon, but that whole water thing has been buggin me for awhile Well seeya! Er yeah I'm back It's been awhile, (at least two weeks) since I've written here I've been obsessed with various webcomics, creating the stupidly long new Phobia Quiz and being maniacly hysterical about my site always being down due to bandwith issues I'm goin' light on the advertising at the moment, which is why I'm free to write here I WANT to write But I can't think of anything to write about Typical I finnaly get some free time to rant and rave and all my topics just magically melted away Let's see what have I ranted about before, subliminal messages, vast breakfast cereal conspiracies, water, uh reality tv? And that's just what I can list from memory Oh, yeah! How could I forget the stupid Tootsie Roll Pop Commercials? TACO is still in my heart *sighs* now let's see what to rant about today I can't think of anything!? Is this writer's block?! Or maybe I just wanna go to bed Sleeping is fun Well let's see Did you know that statistics prove that 45% of all statistics are completly made up by me (The Patron Saint of Paperclips)? Well they are Ha! I see you have no reaction to that, do you Hypothetical Reader? I have once again caused that explody sensation in your brain meats! You cannot DEFEAT me! I rule the er *random Loyal Minion whispers in ear* That's right! I rule the Internet! The Official FLaming-Chickens Handbook already confirms that fact! You CANNOT DENY it! It says that in black and er lime green! It MUST be true! Because it is in those veyr colors that the Matrix is programmed! Ahhh I see your confusion! You cannot follow the vast, mind-boggling logic that is ME! Wait how how can I BE logic? That doesn't make any sense you can't BE something abstract can you? Now MY brain meats feel explody That's not fair! I see your EVIL plot now, Hypothetical Reader! You just let me rant on and on for you KNEW that eventually I would confuse myself with my vast puddle of knowledge You are devious I give you that Unfortunantly I must leave before the confusion spreads and I do something stupid like revealing my one weakness before you THAT'S IT! Code 452 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that the Patron Saint of Paperclips (ME!!!) does not, has never, and will absolutly NOT admit to having any weakness besides the aformention indivduals own skin, which isn't even a weakness anyway since no representative of the Dark, Fluffier Side can BE the Patron Saint of Paperclips (Guess, who no no THAT'S IT!) and even if they could it wouldn't do them any good because it would scare them instead of the aformentioned individual Boy I really enjoy confusing myself!:) Seeya! I'm baaaaa-ack! Aren't you happy? Here, see if you can find the super-secret message! While you wait for yesterday's tomorrow, lunge back and remember that day You know the one Yeah, this doesn't mean anything to you Are you surprised? Obviously not Answer me, you blobby looking freak! Or suffer my blindingly moronic nail messages Did you find it? Wasn't it super? And secret? I thought it was But then, I'm me and you're you I think I'm pretty sure you're not me but you could be that other guy Yeah that guy you know who I'm talking about No? Do not MOCK me! I know where you are right now! Spooky, huh? Ooooo time for today's topic My favorite stuff JTHM I have my libraries copy of JTHM I shall quote Noodle Boy for you:) (Full copyright/credit to Jonhnen Vasquez for writin' the stuff, I'm just sharing the spleeny goodness with you) (it's edited, of course, to stay PG13 **** signifies a random naugty word:)) "HEY, DOG ENTITY! RISE UP AND BARE YOUR BISCUIT FILTY FANGS AT THE LEASH WIELDING DEMON!! **** MY NAVEL ITCHES!! MEOW!MEOW!MEOW! CAT CHOW!!! CEASE YOUR FLATULENT WINDS AND HEAR MY MIND NUMBING EXPULSIONS OF WICKED NOISE! GRRR!! CHEESE!!! I SENSE YOUR ENVY OF MY NECK!! AND I DONT BLAME YOU!! DROOOOOL OVER MY MAGICAL POWERS!! I HAVE POWERS PINTO BEANS CAN ONLY DREAM OF! WANNA SEE ME PULL A TAPEWORM OUTTA MY ****!! HUH?! STARE DEEP INTO THE STINKING ABYSS OF MY INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED SLICES!!! HOLY WAX! CHECK OUT MY ARMPITS!!! HEEEEY! WAIDAMINIT!! WAIT JUST A POLYP PICKING MINUTE!! I SEE YOUR GAME! YOU WILL NOT SINK MY CHEERIO!! I SEE WHAT IS TRANSPIRING HERE!!! YOU'RE ALL ZOMBIE THIGH-FAT PEOPLE BROUGHT INTO ANIMATION BY SOME EVIL FORCE OF FORCEFUL EVIL!!! **** THAT LIPSTICKS THE WRONG COLOR FOR YOU!! MOOOO! WOOF! OH, DON'T YOU SEE THE TOENAILS?!! OH, SO SPLENDID!! A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K ! UNDER SUCH EXTREME HEAT, WEAR AND DEGRADATION IS INEVITABLE!! PARTS BREAK AFTER OVERUSE!! AND THAT IS WHY TOASTER PASTRIES WILL BURST INTO FLAMES IF YOU DON'T KEEP AN EYE ON THEM! Now, wasn't that entertainment I added to the lenghth of the LTE without even thinking! That's talent Lots of gooey talent Unfortunatly, I once again am devoid of a topic And any weirdness I could come up with would be normal compared to Noodle Boy, so I bid thee farewell seeya! I'm back And I've realized that I am a complete idiot For an ENTIRE MONTH I have possesed the arcane knowledge, but I forgot to share it with you, my loyal potentially imaginary reader I know You're shocked at my selfish, bad, memory I apologize from the depths of my moosey soul For, you see my life long goal has been fufilled *anticipatory silence* THERE ACTUALLY IS GRAPE PIE!!!! I know you are as shocked as I am One day I was randomly looking up images via Google and 'lo and behold, there it was Grape Pie It was as if it had been just sitting there waiting for me to discover it Apparantly Grape Pie isn't mainstream, but it has existed for some time In obscure cookbooks Well that just makes me filled with gooey happiness Of course, there is also regret after all, I could have made a fortune if I'd been the first to think of it Oh, well There was something else I had to tell you loyal *cricket chirps, someone coughs* fans I can't remember what I guess I'll just rant and rave about that whole vicious downward spiral of my writing I mean, I KNOW people are coming here I have proof! *holds up a piece of paper, which, from a distance, appears to have writing on it* Yes, undenyable proof! But this proof degrades this mysterious, mystical and mystifying "quality" of my words After all, how can I be self derisive, and full of low expectations for this site if I KNOW people are here several thousand of them in fact, in just a few months It's strange I felt more fufilled when this site was a barren wastland of useless space But, if it had remained that way, I would have had no impetus to continue my pointlessly insane ranting Oh, speaking of insane, I STILL need those much needed supplies for the Official Flaming-Chickens Lunar Colony! No one has even bothered to e-mail them to me *sniffle* I needs the duct tape! How can I survive without the sticky goodness? HOW, I ask you!? It cannot be hmmmm maybe I should just use IMAGINARY duct tape it's easier to come by ,but it's much more expensive I'm not sure what to do *enter Squirell* What's that, little Squirell? That's just silly You KNOW I ran out of imaginary money last week when I bought that imaginary country WHAT!? Just "imagine" I have more!? What a crazy idea So crazy it just might work! *scrunches eyes and makes funny sounds* Nope It didn't I guess I'll just have to wait untill my imaginary clone hijacks that imaginary bank truck Until then I have absolutly no imaginary money What ever shall I do? I won't be able to feed my various imaginary pets and friends their beloved imaginary food! Squirell? You gots extra money, don't you? *nods* I thought so You give to me? No? I gives you imaginary IOU's here yours Thank you Squirell *Squirell wanders off in search of electrical sockets to sniff* What's that, Hypothetical Reader? You don't know who Squirell is? You haven't been paying attention have you? She's my little puppy she fears grape flavored stuff, wind, rain, television, noise, silence, small children and pretty much everything She likes sniffing potentially dangerous stuff, like electrical sockets Surely you have heard of her? Still no? Oh, well You know I enjoy having these conversations with you It really lets me get to know you What's that? You say I'm really just talking to myself? What an eccentric idea! To think, YOU are trying to tell ME that YOU aren't here How absurd After all, I'm talking to you, aren't I? *nods* Well, yeah I KNOW I'm actually typing instead of talking Wait a minute so you're saying that I'm talking and responding to you, but you won't be reading this until long after I have finished typing? Now who's the crazy one? For that theory to work, I'd have to be psychic or in possesion of a freaky time-traveling computer Because what you're saying is that I'm talking to people in the future That my words somehow travel accross time (if only a few minutes) and are somehow picked up by future you, and that my responses are dictated by future you's reactions What? You mean that I'm just randomly responding regardless of your reactions? Why, that would be insane, wouldn't it? That's the point you're trying to get across? *pauses* Oh I see You wanna play that way Well two can play by THOSE rules You wanna try to convince me I'M crazy? Well, look at you? How do you know I even exist? For all you know you could be staring at that freaky 3-D maze screen saver with a blank look on your face while you THINK you're reading an inhumanly long text For all you know, you could be halucinating my entire site! For that matter, how do you know that ANYTHING but you exists! You could be floating out in empty space, conjuring nice little fantasies to relieve the monotony of being the only living being! Every single person you know could just be figments of your imagination, you could even be in a crazy house! Not only that, but how do you know that YOU actually exist? You could be the figment of someone else's dream What would happen when that dreamer woke? Are you happy? You got me started I may NEVER shut up I'll just go on and on about how crazy you COULD be All because YOU tried to convince me that I was crazy *blinks* And I STILL can't remember what else I was gonna say to you people Strange, huh? Well, I better leave before I go on and on about more "reality" theories Makes you wonder about "reality" television, huh? Seeya I'm back Grrrr I had a nifty rant all planned out in my head And then I was unable to get on the computer and I forgot most of it Oh, but I did remember what else I wanted to say to you people Remember that rant I did on how there could be a secret camera in the smoke detector? I few months ago I saw a movie about that It was pretty good Maybe I'd seen it before, and that's where I got the idea I forgot it's name Well I DO have a special treat for you weirdos who apparantly like wasting time! Today, in my (Honors) English class, we did group work My group well we either went hysterical or crazy, I can't decide which We had to do an essay on a book There was a sample essay online It sucked It tooked about envelooping (enveloping) cracked nuts and parables So we were already off to a bad start Here is the sum total of my group's work (Note: I wrote virtually none of this, so I cannot be blamed, credited with any of this "Lots of death, lots and lots of death in this section Death is like life in that after you die some things start life again inside of you 'Ah the power of cheese!' The author's vision was unique in that only he put biscuits and death in the same sentence 'I found nothing else to do but to offer him on of my good Swede's ship's biscuits I had in my pocket'" And we're supposed to be GOOD in English! We KNEW how terrible it was, but we just didn't bother to change it Especially the part about the biscuits and cheese We just picked random words in the selection and wrote about them It was sad In any case, I hope you enjoyed our patheticness Seeya! I'm back Today I will be mercifully brief I am here to bring AWARNESS to your moosey soul! Right now, while you are sitting in your "chair" and eating your "junk food", millions of almonds are commiting suicide Yes that's right suicide I was alerted to this growing problem in our world community by (Kat, the ruler of all that is almondy) and it greatly concerns me People just don't realize that their almonds and mixed nuts may be having depression and other problems We need to act now! For more information, e-mail EnpuUnknown@msn com Well seeya! I'm so very, very tired Today was Halloween I worked for four hours at the "Library of Terror" sponsered by TAB TAB members got pizza lots of pizza and candy Ugh It was fun, but exhausting I was almost completly covered in (fake) blood it was sticky toward the end One guy was a "shock therepy" patient he was a good actor He acted like he was really being tortured and stuff I'm tired I bet you couldn't tell Why am I writing? Because this is the first time I've been on a computer all day You can't blame me Don't worry, I'll go to bed soon In the mean time, I'll just sit here and type with my eyes closed It's hard to type because of the bandaid on my finger I accidently cut it with scizzors It hurt The fake blood seeped into the open wound Gee I sure hope it wasn't poisonous If so, I guess I won't be writing here for quite awhile seeya Okay, this next rant has nothing to do whatsoever with Halloween which is to be expected because it's been several days since then Anyway, today's rant is about one of my many and various pet peeves: fasion and stuff My definition of fasion includes clothes, shoes, jewelery and all things of that nature Now, don't get me wrong I can appreciate a spiffy black outfit as much as the next person, but everytime I consider actually buying clothes for aesthetic value, I think about how I could better spend my money On video games Sure, some of this "fasion" stuff is cool and all, but all it shows is that you had the three and three-quarters brain cells required to copy someone else's "look" And don't even get me started on earrings My little, eviler sister got her ears pierced when she was relativly younger My mom did it to her because it was free OF FREAKIN' COURSE IT WAS FREE! Just like thos so called "diet supplements" that give you a "free" sample because they know that once you try it, you'll like it so much you'll spend oodles of cash on it (There's probably drugs in it) Anyway, like the "diet supplement" people, the earring manufacturers KNOW that once they pierce you, you'll be hooked for life *pauses* *groans* I'm sorry for that pun (pierced, hooked, getit?) AS soon as you're pierced, you have to buy "starter" earrings Then you'll need an "extra" pair for special occasions Before you know it you'll realize that you need Christmas earrings, Halloween earrings, Valentine's Day earrings, St Patrick's Day earrings, for crying out loud! You'll wear these "festive" earings for about a day and then abandon them in some dark cranny of your closet because you simply can't wear the same earrings two years in a row for heaven's sake! Then you'll see these cute little "days-of-the-week" earrings at the mall, and you'll just have to get a few sets, just in case you lose some By the time you're eighty, you'll have enough ear jewelry to open up your own jewelry shop Of course, you won't want to do that becuase you still need more earrings so people won't think you wear the same ones over and over again When I think of how much money people WASTE on appearences, it makes me feel like projectile vomiting If that's not a vast conspiracy, then nothing on this Earth is Now, I'm not speaking from personal experience here No one I know is that obsessed with earrings, it was just an example (Although my mother does have a "earring tree" ) Sure, certain members of my family do pay WAY to much attention to fasion, but that's just because of the expectations of society I, being weird, am pretty much immune to such expectations Except those specially formulated for weird-o's like me If I were to suddenly convert this entrie site into a *shudders* Backstreet Boys fan site or something, you wouldn't be any more suprised than I would be if my brother woke up one day and suddenly realized that he's shallow It's the same concept (No, I don't like any of those creepy "pop" stars I think that they should routinly die a slow, savage, agonizing death I was just saying a random thing that I would never, ever do ) Well any way seeya! I'm back And today's rant is a sort of philosophical one It's about the (supposedly) infinite nature of the universe Suprised? It's spiffy You see, if the universe is indeed infinite, that means that literally EVERYTHING is possible, and in fact, is happening somewhere in the universe Think about it No matter how unlikely something is, if the universe is infinite, it's happening an infinite number of times Think about that old saying about "If you gave an infinite number of monkeys an infinite number of typewriters, eventually they would reproduce the entire works of Shakespear" That makes complete and total sense! Anyone just randomly typing letters will eventually accidently write a word, right? Now think of 100 people typing randomly You figure that one of those 100 people would actually have a coherent phrase And one out of a million people would probably have a few sentences So if you have an infinite number of people, some are going to have entire books of coherent stuff And, you have to remember that because infinity is infinite, you can divide it an infinite number of times Try it If you have a decent graphing calculator, plug in the infinity symbol divided by anything, (even infinity) The answer is still infinity Using my philosopy, that EVERYTHING exists because the universe is infinite well think about it In some far off world, there are pokemon there are an evil race of muffin like creatures, there is a world with ABSOLUTLY NO COMMERCIALS DURING TELEVISION! I know, unlikely, huh? But somewhere, it exists Think about it If the universe is infinite it would be crazy to think that we're alone With an infinite universe, there are infinite possibilites There ARE aliens Not only that, but there are an infinite number of different kinds of intelligent life Which means that there are an infinite number of worlds with humanoid life (Think of the fake-looking Star Trek aliens) If there are an infinte number of worlds with human life, than there are an infinte number of worlds that have someone exactly like you, with only a few key differences (Like alternate dimensions and stuff) So, there is a world where you are the creator of this Longest Text Ever There is a world where you are a faerie There is a world where you were never born There is a world where you are a slave to your TOASTER OVEN The possibilities are literally endless Every fantasy the human mind has concieved exist at some place in the universe There are an infinite number of worlds with Harry Potter Think about it I came up with this philosophy when I was in fifth grade I'd tell it to my little brother as a bed time story He always enjoyed it because it meant that somewhere, he was the Supreme Dictator of the Galaxy That made him happy He ignored the fact that he was also a 72 year old "sanitation engineer" somewhere All the good possibilities effectivly cancel out the bad ones, leaving the sum total of you and your counterparts experiences as nothing You don't have the best life of your counterparts, but you don't have the worst either Because that would be impossible There is always someone worse off and better off than you Because there are an infinite number of people on either side of the spectrum Confusing, huh? But that's the kind of thing I like That also explains why normal stuff confuses me I'm sure some so called "scientist" can prove all my theories wrong but how? How do you PROVE something is not infinite? You'd have to find the end, of course But how, may I ask, can you find the end of the FREAKIN' universe? What, is there a giant sign saying, "DEAD END"? The universe is EVERYTHING, how can it end? At the same time, how can you prove something IS infinite? You could travel in a straight line at the speed of light for a million years and all you'd prove is that the universe is really, really big But you'd never prove it was infinite How could you? Our mind's cannot conceive of the vastness of infinity We'd probably go crazier In any case, my theory means that playing video games is very cruel Why, you ask? Because in some world, the video game is real So when you kill, or whatever, in the game, you are actually ending life somewhere in the universe Of course, you also end life by sneezing, eating, sleeping, and watching T V According to my theory that everything is real Of course, if everything is real then the Universe is pretty contradictory The paradox of my system of beliefs leads me to believe that the universe, in fact, is not infinite Because nature supposidly abhors a paradox Although, as I said, there's no way to prove me wrong OR right That's what I like about making abstract theories Anyway, sorry for the lack of relative weirdness, conspiracy theories and doughnuts (my Moose ate them all) Well now that I think about it according to my theory, ALL conspiracies are real and mislabled "paranoid" people are really the only ones who see the truth *blinks* Wow so I'm NOT paranoid Who'da thought it? Well better go before one of my two and half sane readers falls asleep:) Seeya! I'm back! Boy, are you mythical, mystical readers in for a treat, today!

"Meg" wrote it for a school assignment We were supposed to write about a cherished child-hood toy, and attempt to turn our fond memories into a commercial I wrote about furby, and how it was fun to watch it die No, really Somehow, I managed to make my furby die It would sneeze, then start it's eight-hour-long death hum It would hum, and hum, and hum and then mercifully die I don't exactly have a good track record with virtual pets I once *embarassed pause* had "Hey, You! Pikachu!" a pokemon game I'll only say that it was the first game you could "talk" to and was the first (and only) N64 virtual pet Pikachu well he didn't like me I gave him cupcakes, and presents, and did everything I could to befriend him! And what did he do to me? He snuck up on me one day in our room (in the game) with a sword! That's right, a sword! He tried to kill me! I heard something and turned around, and there he was! He even tried to hide the sword behind his back! When I tried to talk to him, he tossed it away nonchalantly and pretended he hadn't heard me Then he preceeded to trash my room, scattering kleenex everywhere I'm pretty sure that the "smelly yellow ball" that he started throwing was his own feces (poo) That dirty little rat Awwww isn't he cute? Hmmmm I suppose I should clarify that the Pikachu game was 3-D and your character was in first person mode(you see through character's eyes) Otherwise you'd think I was delusional, or something Everyone I know who has played that game is shocked when I tell them oh, well Speaking of virtual pets, I'm revamping the ones on this site I've finnally figured out sorta, maybe, kinda, how to do stuff to make it more real Anyway, seeya! OOooooo! I'm back, and I had yet another Asparagus War with some people We made a guild, and I wrote out the transcripts of the first ever Asparagus War in narrative form (mock epic, very cheesey) Since it's very, very long, I'll post it here to meet my imaginary word quota for the day! Oh, and all those weird squiggly lines and symbols, those are supposed to be apostrophes, but neopet's code is weird, and I'm not gonna bother to edit it Enjoy! And, on the 15th day of the Month of August, in the year of our Lord 2003, at approximately 7:52 p m a great and wondrous battle was fought in the waste lands of the General Chat Room â€˜Lo, and eon337 did wield the mighty Swiss-Asparagus, and did attempt to vanquish her foe, the Evil and Fluffy preggypreggy Preggypreggy had tamed the fearsome Asparagus Sword, and many a foe had she slain with her valor But behold! For the Swiss-Asparagus did slice, and dice and was capable of turning itself into julienne fries! And so it seemed that the two mighty warriors were evenly matched and that their struggle would never come to and end They didst charge at each other with a terrible noise and clamor, and the skies did shake and the earth did tremble at the ferocity of their mighty blows! The stereotypical Asparagus Sword didst fail to hit its mark and eon337 did mock the Sword for itâ€™s falling Translation: On 8-15-03, 7:52 NST, eon337 and preggypreggy grabbed some Asparagus Themed weapons and fought They made fun of each otherâ€™s weapons, and generally kept missing each other every time they swung And eon337 did think long and ponderous and in so doing converted the puny Swiss-Asparagus into the mighty and powerful toothpick And the masses did gleam the significance of this act and they were awed by the grace and cunning of the wooden speck And preggypreggy was immune to the verbal slings and arrows of her foe, and refused to be disheartened by eon337â€™s dishonorable insults Her claim being that function of a weapon is to be put before the ornate form She endeavored to thwart eon337â€™s plans to defeat her with the great and wondrous toothpick She didst again pummel the air with her sword, but in her enthusiasm her blows didst fall far from their mark And the masses didst cheer for eon337 as she had impressed them greatly and they made the sounds of impressive wonder Translation: Eon337 turned a perfectly good Swiss-Asparagus into a toothpick to gain the approval of the studio audience The audience oooed and awed Preggypreggy continued to swing wildly around, missing each time She ignored eon337â€™s insult and said that at least her sword worked And then a new challenger didst arrive at the arena and scoobychick6900 didst fling bowls of asparagus at the fighting mortal enemies Preggypreggy appealed to the masses, but to no avail, and was heartily surprised when the asparagus did hit her And â€˜Lo! The masses didst condemn scoobychick6900 loudly and vehemently and there was much rejoicing in the land Preggypreggy didst fancy that she had perhaps met scoobychick6900 previously, and so did attempt to recollect when Eon337 did take advantage of the lull in action and did attack preggypreggy with her finger Preggypreggy did retaliate with the awe-inspiring SuperPoke, and eon337 was laid low upon the ground in agony Translation: Scoobychick6900 showed up and threw bowls of asparagus Eon337 poked preggypreggy, and preggypreggy poked back, harder Eon337 was hurt And with victory in her mighty vision, preggypreggy didst decide to reveal her secret weapon, and with a fancy hand movement, revealed the extent of her traitorous ways For all know that the bagels and the doughnuts didst disband in ancient times of old Preggypreggy, through her treacherous methods, had obtained the Flying Doughnut of Doom and didst endeavor to use it Eon337 was readily prepared for such an occurrence and didst arm herself with mighty ear-shields, armor that didst repel all projectiles of metal, a head covering, and an outer covering of strange, transparent material that didst snap whence it was squeezed Aragorns_cutie then didst show up with the almighty nemesis broccoli and an unnecessary sneer upon her countenance _Radical_girl_ did break the protocol and didst claim to rather fight with cucumbers, and so it was done And the masses rejoiced And eon337 didst not hear the newcomers because of her mighty ear-shields, and didst offer the fighters dressings for their wounds Translation: Preggypreggy revealed that she had a secret weapon from Ancient Times, although eon337 was prepared for it, with earmuffs, bulletproof armor, and bubble wrap Two new fighters showed up and did random things Eon337 offered Band-Aids And aragorns_cutie didst laugh in a manic way, and didst wave the broccoli to and fro in a threatening manner And eon337 did finally recognize the newcomers, and ask, neigh, commanded they give preggypreggy healing strips And _radical_girl_ didst howl furiously and implored the fighters to meet their DOOOOOOOOM And so hiamplidude didst come to the battle and didst posses the almighty Asparagus Cannon, and did thinkest himself invincible Following himaplidude camst nemmisis_dude, who didst offer the warriors ponderous messages such as: THIS TRULY WORKS! POST THIS IN 10 DIFFERENT BOARDS AND YOU WILL FIND A BABY PAINTBRUSH WHEN YOU GO TO CHAT PREFERENCE AND 10000000000NPS! THIS TRULY WORKS, TRUST ME And the warriors didst consider nemmisis_dude a profit, who was devoted to speaking in tongues so as to convey a message from the gods And â€˜Lo! Nemmisis_dude didst reveal his Bow and Asparagus and the masses rejoiced And eon337 didst intimidate her foes by snapping her transparent covering and shrieking that she was invincible Translation: Random stuff happened, and more people showed up Someone spammed the message board so people ignored it and eon337 went crazier And â€˜Lo! The writer of this cheesy epic didst realize that virtually every sentence begins with â€œandâ€, and the masses rejoiced _radical_girl_ didsâ€™t chase random people with her broccolis, and didst miss in her mighty swings Hiamplidude didst take out nemmisis_dude, and gloried in his honor and didst receive a spinach gun from the gods Preggypreggy was threatened by the randomness, and didst call her secret weapon, the Mighty Evil Flying Donut Of Doom! Eon337 realized preggypreggyâ€™s unprecedented treachery and didst cower in her impotence before one so Dark and Fluffy And aragorns_cutie had ex-lax and _radical_girl_ didst covet invincibility and so did don a pool covering Nemmisis_dude was revealed to be unharmed by hiamplidude, and didst fire at preggypreggy with an asparagus gun But preggypreggy didst forget one thing: eon337 still possessed the support of the ignorant masses, which guaranteed her inevitable victory And preggpreggy scoffed at eon337â€™s supposed advantage and didst claim that even the ravenous horde of the people didst not conceive of her one vulnerable point And preggypreggy didst close her mind to the truth: the dark side is fluffy Translation: Preggypreggy called the Flying Donut of doom and eon337 called preggypreggy a traitor The newcomers did random tings, and eon337 reminded everyone that she still had the support of the studio audience Preggypreggy refused to see it as an advantage, and refused to believe that she was on the Dark, Fluffier Side And behold, for eon337 didst transform the Asparagus Toothpick into a Aspara-Launcher and didst call preggypreggy deceived in her way of thinking, for the Dark Side is always Fluffier And preggypreggy didst call forth the creamed cheese from the bowels of the Evil Flying Donut of Doom and the masses did rejoice, and wallowed in the fattening substances that fell from the air like a gift of mana from the gods And eon337 didst fire projectiles at preggypreggy and unexpectedly mimicked the holy Matrix in her cries of â€œDodge thisâ€ And neoshadow08 didst arrive and inquire as to whether rubber chickens were allowed, and the multitudes said yes Preggypreggy, in her infinite wisdom, failed to see the connection between Darkness and Fluffiness, and was so forsaken by the masses And greyratt didst claim to have invented a new, spookier type of asparagus that never caught on, and the multitudes rejoiced Preggypreggy didst dodge the projectile, and gained honor amongst the masses As the theological debate about the Dark, Fluffier Side raged on, the newcomers fought with the dung of dogs, the chickens of rubber and other such unorthodox weaponry as greyratt didst play with discarded asparagus Translation: Some stuff happened here No, really! Eon337â€™s toothpick became an Aspara-Launcher, and preggypreggy and eon337 argued about whether the Dark Side was Fluffy or not Neoshadow08 and greyratt came, and did stuff Preggypreggy released cream cheese from the Flying Donut of Doom And eon337 didst revealth that she didst posses the Ultimate Asparagus Themed Weapon, too terrible to be named, oh, what the heckth, the name didst ring and was The Thermo-Asparagus-Nuclear-Weapon And preggypreggy didst begin to crack under the strain of the Squeak of Death, and so in his infinite understanding, neoshadow08 didst remove the Squeak of Death and didst replace it with the Chic Attack Aragorns_cutie didst protest the violence, and didst consume the flavorful tomato paste And moonbeam998 didst come, a magical priestess full of arcane knowledge Her mighty glance didst fall upon the warriors and she didst proclaim: THIS TRULY WORKS! POST THIS IN TEN DIFFERENT BOARDS AND YOU WILL FIND A BABY PAINTBRUSH WHEN YOU GO TO CHAT PREREFERENCE AND 10000000000NPS! THIS TRULY WORKS, TRUST ME! And the warriors were mystified by her meaning, but verily they didst decide that it meant for them to continue their holy battle, in the name of whatever great and mysterious god moonbeam998 didst represent Scoobychick6900 didst return to pummel the warriors with bowels of asparagus, as in times of old Translation: Eon337 got out the Thermal-Asparagus-Nuclear-Weapon, and neoshadow08 stopped squeaking and started the Chick Attack Yet another person spammed the message board, and was equally ignored Scoobychick6900 returned And neoshadow08â€™s baby chickens didst fall unto the warriors from the sky, and didst pummel the brave fighters unmercifully And scoobychick6900 didst offer to the warriors magical rainbow colored pellets, which she didst hurl at them forcefully with a gun The magic pellets were then revealed to be the chickenâ€™s only weakness And the warriors were locked in a deadly struggle, each using their unique methods and weapons And the masses didst rejoice yet again And then â€˜Lo! For preggypreggy was forced to valiantly flee the battlefield, and acceded the victory to eon337 And the masses looked confused Eon337 didst admit that preggypreggy didst fight a valiant battle Skuld815 didst arrive and didst proclaim the battle strange and didst fling M & Mâ€™s at the warriors And scoobychick6900 didst proclaim that Rice Krispies were much more powerful than other weapons, and didst think that she was the only warrior left She did wail with despair as she didst discover that eon337 remained in the land of the living Translation: Neoshadow08 caused chickens to fall from the sky, and scoobychick6900 fired skittles at people Preggypreggy had to leave, and skuld815 showed up Scoobychick6900 thought she was the last fighter left, but was not And eon337 and scoobychick6900 were locked in a deadly struggle, candy versus vegetables And neoshadow08 didst summon the Great Banana for advice, and the masses were stunned Oh, the ground did shake, and the mountains trembled The very stars became irregular in their rotations And so the Great Banana was called, and it was good And scoobychick6900 revealed that she had indeed blasphemed against the Great Banana and she didst quake in terror and attempted to corrupt eon337 into blaspheming as well And shadow9441414 didst arrive with two prodigious asparagus swords And spicychibie didst arrive and was proven to be crazier than all others, and the masses were impressed Behold! Eon337 didst prostrate herself before the might of the Great Banana and didst beg for his aid in defeating scoobychick6900, and the Great Banana didst forgive eon337 and giveth her a banana And spicychibie didst partake of the asparagus and didst faint And the Great Banana didst advise eon337 to not rely on the strength of others, but to rely on the strength within And scoobychick6900 didst appeal to the Great Banana and didst beg for forgiveness And the Great Banana didst not make a reply, but instead didst close his eyes and did a perfect mimicry of sleep And scoobychick6900 didst blasphemy again and didst explode bombs of rainbow color And eon37, in the callow impatience of youth, didst detonate the Thermal-Asparagus-Nuclear-Weapon And the masses were blown away As the smoke, and rubble and debris were dissipated, behold! The Great Banana was vanquished! And eon337 didst lament this fate, for her weapon hadst been aimed at scoobychick6900 And scoobychick6900 didst revel in the defeat of the Great Banana, and didst stab at eon337 with its decapitated stem And neoshadow08 was forced to choose sides, and â€˜Lo he choose eon337! And the warriors didst depart, if not friends, then less angry enemies And so ends the first of: The Asparagus Wars Chronicles Translation: While eon337 and scoobychick6900 fought, neoshadow08 called the Great Banana Scoobychick6900 claimed to have eaten the banana the previous night, and feared the bananaâ€™s wrath The Great Banana was defeated, and everyone decided that the war was over Wasn't that entertaining? Seeya! I'm back! Woooooooooooo! Guess what? Yep! *happy wiggle dance* I gots the first shipment of the much needed (pictures of) supplies for the Official Flaming-Chickens Lunar Colony! Woooooo! I feels the happy! This has been a short announcment to document the happy wigglienss that is me Seeya! I'm back And vaguely depressed For the longest time, random people have been coming to my site, and staying 0 00 seconds! How is this possible? Do they not even look at my site? How can they be so cruel, to click, but not look? Grrr I asked Santa why this was so but he doesn't talk to me anymore, after that incident when I was a kid You see *start wavy flashback lines and dreamy music* When I was a kid or whatever I asked Santa for nuclear warheads, helicopters, tanks and possibly legions of doom No, seriously! (I was twelve and forced to communicate with Santa so that my younger siblings did not guess the truth (what truth?) there is no spoon (badly done Matrix parody)) Anyway Santa didn't come through The creep! How was I supposed to conquer the world without those supplies? All I got was a Lion King video and other random stuff How did this help me? I vowed revenge against Santa after all, it would have benefited him to help me Once I was the Undisputed Lord of the Universe, the world would have been a spooky place And all the little children wouldn't have been "good" anymore, since they would be free of thier Authoritarian Parental Units and the definition of "good" (to a parent, at least) is to obey your parents and not embarrass them Soooooo Santa would have had it easier No "good" children would have meant that Santa could have had a permanent vacation in the Bahahmas, not molested by my Legions of Doom because after all--he had delivered the world to me in a brightly wrapped gift box The man would have been more trusted than my trusted Lieutenants! (funny word had to use spell check to spell it ^^;;) But that jolly old IDIOT had to mess things up So, to get back at him I not only continued to not believe in him, I attempted to convert all the miniony children at my disposal (okay not really, the idea just occured to me) so I ask you *cough* Loyal Reader, to immediatly cease believing in Santa I figure that--like Tinkerbell--he will evenutally perish if he doesn't have enough people believing in him What is this? You wish to rule the world, too? Well, you can't! It's mine! Blasphemy! You dare to challenge MY rule? You are a fool! Okay yeah my whole Santa plot IS kinda dumb but that's just a front so that you never guess my REAL plot! That's right cower before my power! *insert evil, insane cackle here* I shall defeat you, Anonymous (another tricky word) Reader! Gah! I'd better go before you trace my location thorugh the Internet and send your Governmental Spyders to me! Ooops I gave you an idea, didn't I? Well, don't use it! It's mine, you are a copy cat! Seeya *appropriate evil glare* I'm back! And, seeying as you MUST be tired of MY ranting, I have a special treat for all you hypothetical two and a half readers out there! You get ranting from somebody else! I won't bother to introduce them, since they do a good job of it themselves here we go: Hiya This is not PSOPC today This is PSOCB (Patron Saint of Carbonated Beverages) We are the two original Head Saints, but for some reason, she gets all the attention Guess I should get out of bed once in a while huh Originally, I thought up the whole Patron Saints of the Order of the Flaming Chicken (when I should have been taking notes in Trig), but PSOPC is more creative and she elaborated on it more so I was drawing "suppressed rage in bunny form" comics then and didn't care I must say, she's gotten very good at thinking randomy thoughts, whereas, I'm just stoopid and something dumb pops out of my brain like floppy bacon from a toaster I drank half a bottle of soy sauce today just to see if it gave me x-ray vision, but alas, I had nothing I wanted to look through (okay, I'm lying I drank the whole thing on a dare ) By the way, soy sauce is gross Who invented it? --"Why gee whiz, Bert! I think we should mix soy beans with water and have chinese for lunch!!"--"Why, indubitoubly Samson! Not only will it taste like crap, we'll get the runs!!!"-- If you don't know what the "runs" are, consult old people, like my dad If you are in high school or college and have a job, this works great When I call in sick (when I'm sick of working, not actually sick), I always have nosey bosses who want to know exactly what my symptoms are and how bad I found a way to make them not WANT to know I told my sister to try it once and it worked for her too You just call up work, use a very retarded, slow, lisping voice when you say this: --"Weeelllllllll, I woked up this mornin' with a terrible headache so I took some aspirin with theraflu By the way, those don't mix too good, now I have a tummy ache, my nose is runny and bleedin', my spleen feels like its gonna 'splode, I'm a tad gassy, and I got the RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!-- At this point, you'll want to use an annoying high-pitched growly voice (think drunk Barney from The Simpsons after sucking helium balloons), raspberry a few times with your toungue and hang up I have much to do now, so thus ends this portion of my guest rant I'll probably want to do this a few more times just because I can Weeee Bye now! I bet you, loyal *hmmm I don't want a cricket maybe a nice annoying gnat or something okay instead of the cricket * readers can't wait for the next time I don't rant! Right? Weeeellll I DO have a topic for today a topic so wonderful that it will also be included in the next OFCEM! What is this magical topic, you ask? Why, opposite day, of course! You see er well how should I begin? Opposite day is, of course a day in which everything you say means the exact opposite It is practiced (informally) by many elementary schoolers I honor this er honored tradition But, to my dismay, I discovered a fatal flaw with opposite day By my reasoning it COULD NOT EXIST! Yes I know blasphemy, right? But it could not be disputed If you were to tell someone that it WAS opposite day they would have to take the opposite of what you just said which would mean that it WASN'T opposite day And, of course, if you were to tell someone that it WASN'T opposite day there would be no reason for them to take the opposite of what you said and so it still WOULDN'T be opposite day! Confusing, huh? But I have now seen the light! The answer to this moral dilema has been so neatly resolved, by Jesse He is er well I'm not sure how old but he is in the third grade He is either a genius or really weird like me (Come on, be honest how many of you random people have put any though into opposite day or even know about it?) He said that to make it opposite day *dramatic pause in which the PSOPC stares into space vacantly* all you had to do was say that it would be opposite day in 5 seconds! PURE GENIUS! Since it is not yet opposite day, you don't have to take the opposite of the statement and so can take it at face value! Do you care, Loyal *gnat/cricket sound* Reader? *stunned* You don't!? Why ever not!? It is the most important discovery since since er since GRAVITY! (Although it is evil and squishying my spine ) How can you remain apathatic at a time like this!? The fate of mankind has been forever altered! Oh Yeah I guess you are right I AM just rambling so that this Longest Text Ever gets even longer But I DO care about this topic There's not even a conspiracy! Well fine! Be that way! Goodbye! I'm back *twitch* and seriously annoyed Grrr time to yet again complain about my *twitch* evil family It is once again the time of year that makes entire families bond together in the same sense that cats and dogs bond together when they have rabies The time is science fair time My younger, eviler sister does a science project every single year *twitch* The concept of science projects strikes fear in my mother's heart She can not stand them Naturally, this is why she takes over the project and does it for my little sister Unfortunatly, this means that I am often called on for my "consultant" abilities *twitch* In other words, I do the experiment, and think of all the results, and the wording of everything I then interpret my work for my mother, who writes everything down because she has really, really obsessivly neat handwritting Of course, my mother gets stressed merely handling paper that will potentionally be USED for a science project, so this is a very, very negative situation Oh, and my mother refuses to even entertain the notion that my little sister might possibly be of help *twitch* At this very moment my little sister is watching a Disney movie, while complaining of a headache *twitch* My mother is getting more and more aggravated as I try to explain that my sister might fail if it looks like she didn't do the project I am currently on strike I refuse to assist this project in any further way untill my little sister does freakin' SOMETHING Wow Speak of the devil My sister IS doing something She is RE-WRITING everything my mother just wrote Like mother like daughter *twitch* I guess this is my mother's way to make sure the judges don't know that my sister didn't do the project My mother makes my sister redo everything over and over again because it's not perfect enough for her Now she is the one who's getting yelled at I guess I can't help but feel sorry for my evil sister *pauses* I guess I'll stop complaining, then God I have a headache seeya I'm back *shakes head* And I have (yet again) a rant about the sheer weirdness of my family Previously I have ranted about our fun-filled family outing to a bar, and about my non-gender specific siblings obsession with dead animals Somehow, these two occurances have joined in an unholy union to create: The Roadkill Sightseeing Event of Doom! We actually went to a normal resteraunt for dinner, believe it or not On the way back, my mother entertained us with the story of how she had seen roadkill that looked exactly like a dead bear She had later compared notes with one of her wacko friends and they had decided that it was, in fact, a dead wild boar We would be passing by it in a few minutes Oh joy My non-gender specific sibling (henceforth known as my sister) was naturally estatic about these events She wanted to get out and see the boar My mother agreed, and wanted my Dad to turn the car around so we could go to Wal-Mart to buy a flash-light My father refused this We ended up driving right past the supposed location of the boar, much to the dismay of my sister and mother and dare I say it? Yes I dare My BROTHER was even interested Faced with direct mutiny from all but me, my father wisely elected to turn the car around We drove off the road and my dad aimed the car headlights at the boar I must say, it wasn't that impressive It was just a lump of black hair, and it was a lot smaller than any bear My sister was impressed, and it was all I could do to keep her from jumping out of the car to it My mother was disappointed, saying that the boar had seemed bigger in the daylight My dad moved the car back and forth, so that we could see the boar on the side of the road more clearly My mother became terrified and decided that we would flip and die All to see a boar After a few minutes, we drove away My mother seemed upset that I had not been interested in her roadkill I can't help but feel cheated Normal families go to museums and theme parks for amusement We view dead animals There is something just SLIGHTLY wrong with this It reminds me of the time a few weeks ago when my mother swore up and down that she saw a grave by the side of the road This bothered her for some time untill one day she finally pulled over to the side of the road and exhumed the shallow grave and discovered that it was actually a deer Luckily, I was not with her this day However, she never leaves any member of our family in the dark concerning roadkill It's just strange Anyway, that's the rant for today, seeying as how there was actually a topic Seeya! I'm back! Seeing how I will shortly no longer be (legally) a child, I have decided to rant about: adults You cannot deny it They are EVIL Think about it! Come, on! Don't be shy! I'm serious When you think of the evil, conniving, conspiratorial ways of adults, what's the first thing to come to mind? The nursery rhyme, 'Mary Had a Little Lamb', right? Huh? You mean it's NOT!? How bizzare, it's obviously a mechanism for brain-washing Anyway, here's MY reasoning for hating the song (and many, many others) Mary Had A Little Lamb makes children resigned to accepting punishment that they don't deserve! You still do not see!? Fine, I shall elaborate This poor little girl's lamb (with fleece as white as snow--an obvious reference to seeming purity) follows her to school one day (which was, oddly enough, against the rules) The kids at school, who were not used to seeing a lamb at school, started to "laugh and play" and basically act like wild animals Now (this is all speculation) I am 90% sure that the final verse (which neither I, nor anyone I asked know) deals with the teacher reprimanding poor little Mary in some way And for what!? The kid's pet followed her to school! How could she stop it, she probably never even thought to look behind her! Not only that, but poor little Mary would never, EVER do such a thing on purpose! Just listen to the SONG for cryin' out loud! The lamb followed HER! She didn't LEAD it! Now, sure, the teacher was probably on her last nerve I mean, she's an ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER She probably doesn't get paid much, or gain much respect from her pupils So, when the children pretty much went wild over the lamb, and she couldn't calm them, she was looking for someone to blame And poor little Mary was a ripe target by then Now, can you honestly picture poor little Mary arguing with her teacher? I didn't think so! Little Mary took her punishment, and her PARENTS were probably so upset that they got rid of her white little lamb And for what!? A teacher's misbegotten pride? Adult supremecy? I ask you, knowing what you know now, could you (in good faith) read this to a young child (implicitly teaching them that it's best not to argue, to simply lie down and let those older than you walk all over you--for "your own good")? And another thing! You know the lullaby, 'Rock A'Bye Baby', the one about the baby in the tree!? What kind of SICKO wrote it!? This poor baby is up in a tree (not the safest of places) in the middle of a freakin' HURICANE! At the end of the freakin' song, the freakin' BRANCH BREAKS and the baby falls, "cradel and all" (presumably to its death) What about Hanzel and Gretel? It's nothing more than a huge threat! "Now, be good or we'll send you out into the woods to be eaten by the witch " What kind of twisted person does that to children? Ring Around the Rosy? It's a song about the Black Plague, the deadliest plague in mankind's history! When you first got it, you'd get a red spot with a ring around it (Ring around the rosy) During this time, people (mistakenly) thought that stench spread sickeness, so they'd keep "pockets full of posies" to ward of the stench of death around them "Ashes, Ashes" was originall "Achoo-Achoo", because the dying would be particularly susceptable to colds "We all fall down"? That's an easy one We fall down dead So, it's obvious that adults don't exactly sugar-coat everything they teach to children I'm sure I can find more horribly EVIL examples, but I simply don't have the time Now, granted, there are SOME (but not many) children's stories that are beneficial Like Snow White, or Cinderlla Those stories teach children to think for themselves, and occasionally completly ignore the adults around them (as long as they are Evil Step-Parents) Well I'd better go *blinks* I wrote a lot today I suppose I should write other stuff but well I figure you need the break to recover your sanity *snort* Like you could do THAT! Seeya! I'm back! As I am writing this, I am in the process of adding a navigation bar to the Longest Text Ever It still is as chaotic as ever, but at least this way people can find certain stuff easier Like the Official Flaming-Chickens Lunar Colony info Anyway, that's about all I have to say right now Seeya! Gah! Fellow Flaming-Chickens, you must see the sheer cool paranoid thinking I have found! Wal-Mart is EVIL! A person (besides me) thinks this! Isn't that cool!? There is even a section on Wal-Mart Subliminal T V (tupperware, anyone?)! Anyway, this has been a short public service annoucement As opposed to one of those long public service announcments that keep on going and going and going I mean, they just never seem to stop, do they? Just when you think they are finally going to run out of steam, they just charge on and on It's like torture, or something Don't those kind of people realize that if they public REALLY cared about the topic, they'd do their own durn research, instead of listening to some self-important moron lecture them about how socially-irresponsible they are? Not that I'm trying to prove a point Quite the contrary: I am merely extending the lenght of this Longest Text Ever to provide an ironic example of self-important morons who just won't stop talking Isn't it entertaining? Don't you just want to here my entire life's story, starting from age 2? You don't? Well perhaps I really SHOULD leave what do you think? Er well seeya! Yep I'm back *traumatic pause* This weekend I went to go visit my future college It was the most traumatizing experience of my life, to date The day before I got there the college had won a basketball game and were going to the finals This naturally caused parties to break out all over campus According to one guy, a couch was "set on fire" *sigh* I was "hosted" (along with two other girls) by some bubbly, perky Greek (sorority (sp?)) girl I hate her so much She never shut up She was so shallow She wanted us to join a sorority, just like her (all paraphrased) Ex 1 "I would NEVER have passed my classes if I hadn't gone Greek" Ex 2 "I just don't see HOW I would have, like, ya' know, managed ANYTHING without my sisters!" If I never see her again it will be too soon Her idea of entertainment was to take us to the recreational center, sit us down in the gym and talk to her friends while watching the guys (badly, this IS an engineering school after all) attempt to play basketball Apparantly all the decent players were at the final game thingy Then she took us to the fraternity next to her house (we didn't even get to "experience" sleeping in an actual dorm) The fraternity was disgusting There must have been 1000 flies, 100 beer bottles, 50 Bud Lite cans, and 5 creepy dudes who were attempting to practice music for some competition After about three hours of this, I almost snapped Me and another girl were supposed to be watching T V , but due to the evil, out of tune, incredibly loud band, this proved to be impossible My "host" and the girl who was enthusiastic about "going Greek" were swimming in a heated pool The other girl (who also hated to swimn) and I started to talk There was nothing else really to do She hated our host and hated the fraternity/Greek thing too We talked for awhile, and some dude joined us He was cool He was regional STAR student for another area Somehow we got onto the topic of religion, and it turned out that the other girl I was with was Muslim, and was born in Egypt It was cool Anyway, it was just the two of us girls in the entire FREAKIN' fraternity (not counting the two swiming girls, downstairs The floor was greasy, and oddly sticky--just like a movie theater When our "host" finnally said we could go, it was close to 2 a m I barely got any sleep grrr not to mention the fact that we had walk to breakfast by 8:00 a m Oh Silly me I forgot to mention a key difficulty We had to WALK EVERYWHERE! Uphill! (But not in the freezing snow, for 15 miles) You have not experinced Jenny's personal Hell untill you have carried your luggage (including a trash bag containing a sleeping back and the trash bags plastic handley-thingies are rapidly stretching out to become lethal weapons similar to piano wire) uphill, upstairs, across campus and up the four or five flights to the breakfast area, only to discover that, Oh! Gee, there was an ELEVATOR that the "host" conviently forgot to mention Even more evil stuff happened, but suffice it to say that when I finally saw my dad at lunch, I begged him to just skip the final sessions because they were pointless (how to choose your major) and go home He went ahead with his sessions, but let me opt out of mine and I slept for 50 minutes on some random couch in the lobby Oh And then the 6 hour drive home *shudders* As you can tell, I am still seriously miffed about the whole experience Sorry for ranting Well there WAS some good things about the whole experience For one thing, it was the first time I'd ever been in a big city The sky line was beautiful! Er yeah that was about it Did I mention the uphill walking part? I did? Oh Well Then I guess I'm done Seeya! I'm back! And I'm here with a Vital Public Service Anouncment for all of my two and a half Loyal, Hypothetical Readers! Don't you feel all special inside? Oh Yeah The anouncment BEWARE OF YOUR OWN FRENCH FRIES That's correct French fries You see, it all started one friday afternoon *start wavy flashback sequence* My friends and I were sitting down to a tasty lunch of Skool Brand food This included, tragically, french fries Oh, what a fateful day It seems like it was only yesterday when we were so carefree and innocent when in fact it was actually only a few hours ago You see, we inadvertantly started a mini-food fight that spilled over into a neighboring table, which also housed our friends Said friends began flingning the aformentioned French Fries at us I shudder to think of how we had laughed and frolicked and otherwise remained oblivious to the tragedy that had yet to unfold For, you see the french fires were pointy and hard And Fate herself seemed to conspire against us (just like the Skool, government, evil cartoon owl, etc ) One single solitary french fry pierced my friend's guard and hit her on the nose with the sharpest, hardest tip a french fry has ever been known to produce We calmed down, and thought nothing of our near brush with Death After all, what can a FREAKIN' FRENCH FRY do, right? Ahhh to be so young and naive again Time passed, as it always does, and "Meg" noticed a speck of something on our friend who had been hit by the projectile french fry The friend (Tonileigh, actually) wiped the speck, only to discover that it was blood THE FRENCH FRY HAD DRAWN BLOOD! It was obviously an evil, voodoo french fry sent to assasinate her by the mysteriously evil Cafeteria Lunch Ladies who needed Tonileigh's blood for their accursed voodoo spells Fortunatly, the quick thinking of "Meg" saved us all and the lunch ladies never obtained their goal Oh And here is yet ANOTHER VERY, VERY, VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC SERVICE THINGY Tag, you're it! These words have haunted nearly ever playground in existance "Tag" is practically all a child learns in kindergarten There is not a person alive who has not played some version of the game And yet what, exactly is "it"? When defining it for my Pronoun Quiz I reffered to "it" as something that "mankind has dreaded for centuries" What made me say such a thing What is it about the unknown, mysterious and faintly ominous "it" that makes people dread it so much? Even the most innocent of children know that to be "it" is to be a virtual outcast of society The youngest child knows that no sane person would want to be "it" Recently a group of TAB members, myself included, set about finding out what "it" exactly is We conducted "field research" (we played a game of tag) When I became "it" I declared that I was touching the bench I was standing on so it became "it" and the bench was touching the ground, and the ground was touching everything on earth, except for airplanes and stuff but even the ground was touching AIR which was touching more air and so on and so on untill the very AIR was touching the airplanes and the airplanes became "it" So the entire earth has actually been "it" from the first game of tag and WE JUST NEVER KNEW IT! I know, I'm just as shocked as you, Hypothetical Reader *shakes head* And all along we had thought that we could somehow absolve ourselves of the burden of being "it" simply by passing it on to another But that is not true We merely pass the awareness of being "it" on but never the actual quality of being "it" The question was raised: Where did the first "it" on Earth come from It was a thought provoking question Some thought that perhaps the first person to invent tag was the original "it" I, however, favored an extraterristrial origin My current theory is that the meteor that supposidly killed off the dinosaurs was the original "it", and that it "tagged" the earth, thereby causeing the earth to be "it" The dinosaurs, of course, could not handle the burden of being "it" which resulted in mass suicides The mammals, being nothing but idiot rodents at the time, couldn't care less about being "it" and eventually forgot all about it Until, that is, some half-remembered special memory popped out of some five year old's brain and he/she invented tag Some people found holes in my theory: How did the meteor become "it"? After much discussion and deliberation, we came to a group consensus that the so called "Big Bang" was actually all the players of the game scattering Similar to the beggining of a game of tag or hide-n-go-seek The players begin huddled together, but when the game starts they scatter and flee from the person/planet/rock who is "it" The only difference I can think of is that rather than passing the "it"ness on, the players merely add to the number of people who are already "it" My theory would also account for the current scientific opinion that the planets/galaxy/universe is moving away from the origin point of the Big Bang After all, if there's no base, why return to where you started? You wanna put as much distance between you and your pursuers as possible Critics wanted to go further, was anyone "it" BEFORE the Big Bang My arguement is this: No one is "it" before you begin a game Any "it" before the Big Bang was part a seperate game, and would therefore be considered a different "it" from the "it" that we fear so much So I believe the question to be a moot point *blinks* What's that, Loyal Reader? I have confused you with my trivalties? You do not understand my obsession with "it"? Shame on you, Reader! Haven't you learned yet that it's my JOB to confuse you and make no sense? Tsk-Tsk Oh, well Gotta go! I'm back, but only for about five seconds Just a little side note here: Remember that rant I did about "pure" water? (don't even get me started) In it I mentioned that fast-food salt lists its ingredients, right? Well, here they are! *takes package of Burger King Iodized Salt out of pocket* Drumroll please and the ingredients are: salt, sodium silico aluminate, dextrose, and 0 01% potassium iodide Wasn't that painstakenly accurate? A hundreth of a percente of the salt was potassium iodide! You can't get much more accurate than that Don't you think that "pure" water has much MORE than 0 01% of some random mineral? Why don't THEY list it, huh? *shakes head* *mutters* Evil, "pure" water companies *wanders off muttering to self and acting like a crazy hobo* Seeya I'm back! And I have yet another footnote to a previous rant! You remember that "infinite possibilities" rant? Here's a quote from a supposed Time Traveler: "Every possible thing that can happen or will happen has already happened somewhere " I love it! Here's another one: "On a philosophical level, the existence of multiple worlds implies a moral balance in the superverse For every worldline you perform a good action, there is a worldline where you perform a bad action There are no good and bad people, just good and bad decisions We can only be responsible for what we do as individuals on the worldline we are on now " These are all exactly what I've been thinking of when I first came up with my infinite universe thingy to tell my little brother when he was bored and wanted his head to explode! Seeya! I'm back And I just wanted to say that I went to Islands of Adventure (in Universal Studios) yesterday It was incredible! If you wanna here about the awesome rides, (esp the Spiderman ride, best 3-d effects and vitual reality I've EVER seen ) just click here *shrugs* This way, if you don't wanna here me rant about it, you can here some guy PAID to rant about it rant about But if you don't want to, you don't got to Seeya! I'm back! Wow *shakes head* My mother never ceases to be amusing Since today IS mother's day, I shall devot this text to her even if it is a bit of satire or whatever You see my mother has found a new "religion" She is reading some book written by some bimbo who has been to "the other side" and conversed with her "spirt guardian" or whatever and decided to share her "relevations" with people willing to pay a lot of money for garbage At least that's my opinion of it My mother, however, takes it all VERY seriously For instance, today at our (almost normal) dinner out she instructed me on the way to get to heaven It involved opening a door Seriously Anyway apparantly once you perish in this realm you are taken to a set of doors The door on the right leads directly to heaven (do not pass "Go" do not collect $200) The door on the left "zaps you into someone's uterus" which, loosely translated, means that you get reincarnated This is the "bad" choice I know this because my sister expressed an intrest in being reincarnated and my mother looked at her with an expression of horror and said solemnly that if she did that "God would never forgive" her She then proceded to tell us that if you were reincarnated you had to live out multiple lives until you were ready for heaven *shakes head* Maybe I'm missing something, but if "God would never forgive" someone who innocently chose the wrong freakin' door, wouldn't that indicate that such a person would be barred from heaven forever? Isn't there just the SLIGHTEST bit of inconsistancy here? Why would somebody get punished by randomly choosing the wrong (apparantly unlabeled) door? Look I don't mean to offend ~ < If you happen to be part of this religion (which prophecies Elvis's return sometime this year (2004) as "a blond hair, blue-eyed boy") then that's your choice I definitly don't want to get in any theological debates here So I'll move on the a relatively safer topic The National Enquirer They're obsessed with Elvis, too, for some reason I just don't understand why people care I mean, Elvis is always reported as being: abducted by aliens, frozen in a tube in Area 51, having a brain transplant and is now the Pop-Star Britney Spears, and stuff like that One song I've heard even equates Elvis with Jesus, for cryin' out loud! ("You're no Jesus, You're no Elvis" (From Megolomaniac, by some band) Why do people obsess over that poor, most likely dead, man? The world may never know ( And don't even get me started on Tootsie Roll Pops) Anyway, I guess my point is that the book my mom is reading has a similar dedication to accuracty, hard-hitting facts and common sense as the famed National Enquirer (which confidently predicted several months ago that Michael Jackson's "secret Muslim bride" would exonerate all charges of child molestation against him Which, in case you live on the moon, has NOT happened and probably never will) Anyhoo, that's my rant for the day I'll probably post something in l33t eventually seeya! I am back (REAL introduction: Heh-Heh…I had ANOTHER sugar rush And I was just a little bit hysterical The following is my intro I wrote while sugar rushed, and various messages I sent to people while in the same state Don’t worry if you can’t understand it…you aren’t supposed to *sigh* The whole thing is just a blur of those wiggly red lines spell-check uses to tell you that stuff is spelled wrong…) I back! hee-hee! here is ANother sugar coated rant! and I am typing the intro while still hyper/slepepy you see, i drank Sobe energy drink, a cup of sugar (just sugar) and ate cake (yet agina, late at night) So this was the result in various messages I left random peolple *giigleing * Heee0-Heeeee!

All that shorrtting and stuff! I got so many head-shots er can your brother see yet? I'm sorry i hit his eyes dozens of times in a row It was just so fun! we should do that somethimg again you guys weren't taking it very seriously , though *snickers* Hee-kheee funny stuff I ate a CUP of sugar mmmm sugar I wis swaying in the place Sugar and me, we don't g et along so well since I react to it like most people react to beingg drunk or under the ijnnnclunce of other suttff Oh, god sugar i'm gonnat add another sugar rant to the longest text ever (just two ever)!sand for people who dont' know me know, i do k not do stuff It's just that sugar under the wright surcumstances is doin' stuff Okay Is done Mike the Headlessc hickrn day is coming up! seeya later! I'm back It has been a year since the Evil Graduation Post Which means that this year I got to attend my OWN graduation Woo I must say that I was rather underwhelemed by the whole thing *shrugs* Sure, the fireworks were spectacular and there was BEAUTIFUL weather Cool, (not sufficatingly hot) absolutly no gnats for the first time in YEARS, no rain, just nice, soothing speeches that made absolulty no sense At one point, our priniciple yelled at the graduating class because we weren't listening to him The audience (consisting of parents) booed at him So the principal yells at the PARENTS! What was he THINKING!? It's a good thing he's leaving, soon, because otherwise he'd probably been fired Anyway, I just wanted to warn you of the dangers of broccolii: It's a form of lichen/moss that grows abundantly on certain sectors of Mars In recent years, it has been cultivated by farmers into a semi-toxic product meant to augment the on-going brain-washing of young children, with the sole purpose being to turn them into Young Adults Seeya! I'm back I'm just gonna be here for a little while *demonstrates with fingers* so you don't have to worry 'bout crazy, paranoid rants I just wanted to mention that former President Reagan apparantly declared ketchup to be a vegetable Isn't that GREAT! I love ketchup so much I don't even like FRIES I eat 'em 'cause they are a means to convey KETCHUP to my mouth mmmm ketchup Oh Poor, poor Reagan ( he died last week ) Hasta Luego (means seeya later) I'm back *sigh* This dang chatterbot is taking up WAY too much of my time! There's constantly things that needed fixing, updating and improving! Bah! But, I'm obsessed, and I've always been interested in simulated artificial intelligence :) Anyway, I'm making her personality really paranoid (she's based on me) Here are her thoughts concerning cows: *glances around* Just between you and me: I think there is some sort of dairy conspiracy! Ah, the power of cheese! Think about it: they are trying to sub-consciously tell you that THEY hold the power of CHEEESE! And there are few things more powerful than THAT! Plus, the so-called "dairy farmer's of America" who pay for the Cheese commercials OBVIOUSLY have a virtual monopoly on the whole dairy thing They even require that cheese get that little "real cheese" stamp before anyone considers it to be REAL cheese Have you ever tasted fake cheese? Anyway, my point is that it is getting increasingly harder to find the time to make new quizzes, (or add pics to that destiny quiz), and to make coherent entries into this longest text ever *sniffle* I try, though! It's just that it's so FUN to teach PSOPC bot subtle things, that maybe one in every 1000 visitor will stumble on to! Like, when she accuses you of being on of THEM, and you say "yes" she starts to panic, and won't listen to you unless you say somthing to get her attention Ahhhhhhh Well, anyway, enough about my little obsession No sense in boring you all with the little technicall details (frankly, pandorabots has the training interface done really well there is almost no need to know ANYTHING about programming which, frankly I don't ^^;;) Er I guess that's all I have to say now I don't really have much more parnoid conspiracies or strange observations to make Er I guess I could discuss something that has already become obsolete Have you ever been to subway? You have, *nods* yeah I love that place, too Anywaaaays, I went there once and I noticed a poster in the window It showed people of every size, shape and color, all of them in little pics in little neat boxes The text read: Different People Differnt Tastes Okay I could easily see what it was TRYING to say: There is something for EVERYONE at Subway (eat fresh) But my very first thought was: Whoa, hey, are they CANNIBALS!? Because I interpretted it to mean that different people TASTED differnt, and that's what the subs were made out of and why there was such a great variety Er I know, Hypothetical Reader not the best example of my eccentric thought proccess but it's the first one that came to mind *sigh* You know, come to think of it, I bet I HAVE dwindled back down to two and half readers (if that) After all look how LONG this thing is getting! And, well, quite frankly, people are mostly contacting me about PSOPC bot, the OFCEM or the Quizzes, and *sniffle* mostly ignoring this little (note the irony) page Well, seey later! I'm back And, for the first time in quite some time, I am truly pissed off and this is the only way I can vent my anger Gah! Well, I suppose you'll need to know some back story, huh (WARNING: CONTENTS OF THIS PASSAGE MAY CONTAIN DANGEROUSLY LOW LEVELS OF HUMOR, IRONY AND SARCASM READING THIS PASSAGE MAY CAUSE THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS: LACK OF INTEREST, BOREDOM AND A GENERAL SENSE THAT THIS IS NOT LIKE NORMAL RANTS ABOUT PARANOIA, STRANGE OBSERVATIONS AND FAMILY QUIRKS) To begin with, I JUST got a job as a cashier slave at K-Mart NEVERMIND the fact that I've worked at the daycare for A WHOLE YEAR, just so I wouldn't have to work for my final Summer of Freedom Apparantly, my dad does not want me to actually USE any of the money I made from my previous job to buy college supplies Instead, he wants me to learn the horrors of minimum wage employment and induce me to to strive to succede in the college world NEVERMIND the fact that my previous job gave me LESS money I apparantly STILL need to understand that there is more to life than $5 50 an hour GAH! I KNEW that most jobs sucked unless you had a degree (and even then, most STILL sucked)! Why bother to teach me THE SAME FREAKIN' LESSON AGAIN!? Eh I didn't argue, mostly 'cause my dad IS paying for most of the college expenses so I am grateful I just hate K-Mart So today was my biggest shift ever, from 3 pm to 8 pm It's the latest I've ever worked, too I know it's NOTHING compared to a full time job but it's still enough to make me snap FIRST OF ALL well there weren't a lot of customers during the first half of my shift Blessing, or horrible boredom? In either case, I managed to obtain a Bag of Air from a purse someone bought, and (true to form) instead of discarding said air bag, I drew a face on it and decided that it was my pet, Bag Oh, me and Bag had great times I taught Bag how to return (I threw him at a fan and he blew into my face) I introduced Bag to a customer I knew (after they left and I was alone, even I knew that talking to a Bag is weird) *sigh* I hugged and squeezed Bag harder than I have ever squeezed a Moose, because I knew that Bag didn't have stuff like organs The worst that could have happened that he would have exploded in my face, blinding me forever Ahhhhh Bag Then *sniffle* tragedy struck I left my register to get something to restock the candy and when I came back Bag was missing! Frantic, I looked around, and saw, before my very eyes, a fellow cashier puncture my precious Bag with a key! They had thought that Bag was garbage! I had customers and so I had to deal with them, with a false smile plastered painfully on my face, while all the while I was repeating over and over the horrible scene Once the customers left (after what seemed like an eternity) I rushed over to wear I had seen Bag He wasn't there I looked in the garbage can he wasn't there I looked in some nearby boxes he wasn't there I couldn't ASK the other cashier what she had done with Bag no one at K-Mart knows my true weird nature yet So I regretfully had to forego giving Bag his needed funeral respects We had some good times together and we had JUST started to bond when his life was ended I knew that it would happen, eventually Even if I had managed to bring him home, I would eventually have lost interest Bag was the perfect companion for my boring hour and a half But Bag was no more As the time dragged on, more and more customers came During the last hour, the customers started to dwindle off (cool word, huh dwindle say it! Dwiiiiiindle ) I was once again left bored I eventually grabbed a piece of cardboard (hmmmm that came discarded from a bag I sold, too coincidence? I think not!) and started to draw a cute little bunny and a tiger (GAH! I think I left that at the register I bet that EVIL other cashier is throwing it away, right NOW!) I was able to draw in peace for a while, with only the most minor of customer interruptions Then the other Cashier went on her brake We are allowed 15 minutes for our breaks She went 17 minutes before I my shift was over Can you guess what happened? *sigh* I HAD been planning to close up shop at about 7:53 and clock out on TIME for once ( I usually close when I'm supposed to leave and end up clocking out 5 minutes after) So I am looking forward to doing a little shopping (for hand-held Nerf guns) before my parental unit came to pick me up So, predict, if you will, what happend exactly 10 mintues before I was going to close You can't? Well let me tell you: EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE STORE APPARANTLY DECIDED THAT IT WAS TIME FOR THEM TO LEAVE Not all at once, oh, no, they were more subtle than that At first, all I felt was mild annoyance I even thought, oh, I guess I won't finish my pic Then, ten more people were in the line I thought about asking the last person to prevent more people from entering, but I though, Hey, why bother? It's not as if there can be many more people in the store, right? Wrong As I widdled (another cool word) my way through the customers, MORE KEPT COMING After barely having any ALL DAY, all of them swarmed like a hive of malevolent bees GRRRRRR This time I DID ask the last person to keep others out Everyone seemed to be amused I was the only cashier, where would other people go? I explained that they could check out at the service deck, which was an exhausting 25 ft away (I was more polite though) Finnally It was 8:05 and I was on my last customer I was irratated that I wouldn't have enough time to get the Nerf gun, but other than that I was just eager to get home Ahhh those last customers I think they were sent just to try my patience First of all, they bought a few expensive items They gave me a gift card, and they still had $59 left to pay They tried to pay with credit, but it turned out they didn't have enough dough in their account to pay So, they wrote me a check for half the ammount, and then tried to pay the rest with credit The credit machine froze After fiddling with it for a few minutes, I walked those hazardous 25ft to the service desk to ask for assistance I waited while the person delt with a customer I heard someone call my name MY customers were frantically gestering to me So I walked back It seems that they had overestimated their credit account BUT, their boyfriends showed up and gave them 5 bucks, so they gave THAT to me and then paid the rest with credit They left, I closed up I shut my register off at 8:20 pm I glanced outside and saw my parental waiting on me I angrily stalked all the way to the back, and clocked out Then I stalked back and got in the car, at 8:30pm I was furious I had suppressed ALL emotions while actually working, but as soon as I stepped away from that register my dam broke and I was awash in them Gah! Suppression of self (my technique for dealing with any situation involving strangers) just applified my anger by suppressing it By the time I got home, all I wanted to do was mutilate and slaughter helpless animals on my favorite video game (supposidly, the point of the game is to save the world, but I just like shooting the life like animals) Of course, when I got to the PS2 the game was not there I had left it in my OLD PS2 that I had taken with me on my vacation The PS2 is in a box, right next to me at this very moment The game is inside it I COULD plug it in and obtain the game but by now I have mostly excorized my emotions by reliving them by adding to this Longest Text Ever I KNOW it was a petty thing to get angry about but I didn't want to job to begin with (And poor, poor Bag ) I never WANTED a job where you might not get off on time like my friends always complained about McDonalds Like them, if there are still customers I can't leave! To make matters worse, it doesn't even feel as if I am working for money, since all I earn goes in a bank account for my future use I am present oriented! I don't care about some hypothetical future! It's as if I am working for the sole purpose of making my dad happy Eh well enough whining from me Seeya Hiya! And I have a GREAT conspiracy/paranoid rant! Don't you just feel all warm and gooey inside, like melted cheese? Suprisingly enough, this is the topic of today's rant: cheese Mmmmmmmm cheese Mild Cheddar, Mozzerella, Feta, Montery Jack, Colby Mmmmm or what about that Queso Blanco they use in Mexican resteraunts? Mmmmm I love cheese, and chances are: You love it, too There are even commercials, just for cheese Not even a particular BRAND of cheese, just the entire CONCEPT of cheese "Ahhhh, the power of cheese!" And I couldn't agree more But it HAS come to my attention somehow or another that this is and EVIL arrangement Think about it for one moment Have you EVER seen a commercial urging you to buy, for instance, burgers? Just burgers In general No mention of McDonald's or Wendy's, or those frozen Bubba Burgers Just ya' know, the CONCEPT of burgers? How about pain medication? Bannanas? Milk? Ah! There we go Milk Just about EVERYONE has seen those GOT MILK? commercials Every school in my county has a cafeteria chock FULL of posters of celebraties with milk mustaches, with the logo: GOT MILK? Hmmmmm sooooooooo just WHAT do CHEESE and MILK have in common? Let's see BOTH are owned by the United Dairy Farmers of America Hmmm and it seems that OTHER countries have similar such organizations In fact, there is even a CHICKEN Farmers organization (although apparantly it is not United) But other food stuffs organizations just don't seem to be as active as these mysterious dairy farmers Hmmmm Why bother to advertise a product, without bothering to promote a single company or brand name? Wouldn't you think that the companies could handle the advertising themselves? I know Kraft does: *sing*K-R-A-F-T And lots of companies harp on the ammount of calcium in cheese Sooo why do the FARMERS advertise milk and cheese? Is it all a vast conspiracy? After all, this mysterious, spooky organization owns ALL THE CHEESE Shocking, isn't it? So, this complete monopoly of the cheese world controls virtually all prices for all cheese/dairy items, including: Cheese Pizza, Ice Cream, Milk, Cheese, CheeseBurgers, Tacos, Cheesy Bread, Cheese Doritos, Nacho Cheese, Butter, Etc (Etc is not actually a dairy product, consisitng mostly of an ecletic mix of random items, but I figured that it would work to show the continuing theme of dairy type items ) Why does the government allow such a monopoly to exist? Are they FUNDED by the government? Let's see *does a google search* Ooooo! Pay Dirt! I'm not the only one to see the evils of Got Milk! THIS SITE has an arcticle about the anger of small dairy farmers for the monopoly of the "Got Milk?" people Jeff Manning, Executive Director of the California Milk Processor Board is apparantly in charge of this What a strange title Hmmmm *scans the article* Oooo! They notice the non-brand-specific advertising! And it says how they are funded: "So-called “generic” advertising programs such as “Got Milk?” and “Ahh, the power of cheese” are funded, in part, through the congressionally authorized dairy checkoff, which places a mandatory assessment of 15 cents per hundredweight (roughly two cents per gallon) on all milk domestically produced and marketed commercially Last year, the dairy checkoff raked in more than $250 million in hard-earned dairy producer money " Soooo in essence, they ARE funded by the government (or at least in the sense that the government STEALS the small dairy farmer's money to pay for the ads) And they were sued by a small farmer who said: "We’re against having to fork over a huge portion of our bottom line for advertising that says all milk is equal " So they don't WANT to pay for the ads, but the government (and that California Dairy thingy) say they have to Ha! That's hilarious! These stupid Dairy Conglomorate people are actually PAYING a town to rename itself "Got Milk" with those small dairy farmer's money! That's so pointless! It's like they are having these HUGE brain-storming sessions to see how they can best squander those small dairy people's money! "Hmmmm Bob, why don't we buy all those "Largest Block of Cheese" roadside attractions and make a monument with them, entitled 'Ahhh, the power of cheese!'?" "Brilliant, Ted! But, I'd like to go one step further! Let's make an entire CITY out of cheese!" "Bob, that's it! Wait wait! I think I GOT IT! Let's BUY a CITY the idiot yokels to CHANGE THEIR NAME TO GOT MILK! That way, we can still have those cheese ideas to fall back on afterwards!" *shakes head* It's so pathetic *does happy dance* See, here I was ranting and raving about this, and it turns out that there already ARE people outraged! It's like that rant about the smoke detectors, and later I saw a movie about spy cameras in them Or that Grape Pie Rant that ended up with me doing a google search months later (When I was bored) and discovering a pic of it mmmm grape pie It's incredible how many strange things I can get outraged about, only to discover that they aren't strange at all! Well seeya! Wootage! I'm back! And I have a new rant about the evils of parental brain-washing during childhood Consider it a combo of the "Tag" rant and the "Mary Had a Little Lamb" rant *shudders* How could I have missed such obvious implecations!? Gah! I shall focus! Alright the subject of today's whatchamacallit is: Duck, Duck, Goose! It is EVIL! Now, I KNOW that most of what small children learn is actually not-so-cleveraly disguised brain-washing attempts, but this is just plain wrong! For those of you not familiar with the game, let me summarize One child is "it" (JUST like in Tag) This child, labels each of the children, usually as "duck" The other children are sitting in a circle, and the "it" child walks around tapping their heads, going: "Duck, Duck, Duck" Simple enough, right? Ah, but THEN the "it" child picks somebody ELSE to be "it", and tap the unfortunate victim on the head, crying "Goose!" Then the "goose" must pursue the "it" one and attempt to tag them If they do not tag the "it" child, the "goose" becomes "it" If they succede in tagging them, the "it" child goes in the "mush pot" and the "goose" becomes "it" anyway Alright Now you know what the game IS let's move onto what it MEANS First of all, the game is CLEARLY a mock witch hunt The children alienate and ostracize the one who is different, the one who is a "goose" when everyone else are "ducks" The "it" child is the current pariah, and obviously wants to exchange situations with a more fortunate child So, the "it" child desperatly accuses another of being a "goose" (just as condemned witches accused others of witchcraft in order to alleviate their sentence) The child, symbolically shocked and appaled by such wild accusations, denies it, and even goes so far as to pursue the accusing pariah If the accusation is deemed false (i e the "goose" tags the "it") then the accusing "it" child is sent to exile (the mush pot) HOWEVER, the taint of suspicion is already upon the former "goose" and despite protestations to the contrary, the child is the new "it" pariah And the game continues This game is DESIGNED to teach children how to shun those who are different, and to ostracize them from society if neccessary! How can this POSSIBLY be one of those little life's lessons that children must learn to become Responsible Adults? *shakes head in disgust* Well, anyway, that's it for today! Seeya! I'm back! *giggles wildly* Woot! I have something EXTRA SPECIAL for you loyal readers *cricket chirps yet again what is UP with that?*! "Meg", the inspiration to that Pointless Signs of America Rant, has "agreed" to do a rant for us! It's GREAT! *giggles* Well, here it is: "Meg" here Jenny has kindly asked aka threatened me to do a guest rant, and I am only too happy to oblige So here I am ready to inform you of silly things! Let's start! Go! Go! It has come to my attention that Barbie has finally found a new love That's right Bye-bye to boring Ken! Here comes Australian surfer Blaine! At this point, a few of you will be screaming: "No! Ken and Barbie forevaaaaa!" An insane percentage of you will be going: "Oh, that is so cute, Barbie and Blaine! That's great cause, like, both of their names start with B! Heehee!" But most of you will be wondering if that leftover pizza a week ago that is still in the fridge is eatable Trust me on this, it's not So why am I bringing this up? How many of you remember playing with Barbies? (The guys reading this pretend it's G I Joe and his buddies ) Remember when you ripped off Barbie's head and it gave that satisfying pop? And how there was always one Ken doll and a whole bunch of Barbies? And Ken had to choose from his little harem which one he wanted? It was actually training to make you used to Reality TV! The Bachelor is eerily similar to the game you played as a child Ken has to choose between Vet Barbie, Cowgirl Barbie, Teacher Barbie, and Dolphin Trainer Barbie! There's also a million dollars thrown into the mix! (Guys: G I Joe has to decide which of his buddies to vote off the island or something ) Ken was always a favored one! But now with him gone, (Barbie was quoted saying something like, "So long, ya pansy!) how will young girls (and boys) tolerate Reality TV when they are older? Mattel and TV producers are realizing their mistakes, so they decided to hold a vote for the "new man" of Barbie This vote again was a little Reality TV thing in progress The Bachelorette this time Who will Barbie choose? The trendy new guy she chose which, over 2 million people decided, was Blaine Now, girls (and boys) will be racing to get him and the many clothes and surfboard accessories he will undoubtedly have Marketing goes up, and a new generation of potential Reality TV watchers is created The endless cycle continues I hope you enjoyed my rant! And remember! May Blaine always help the masses decide: American Idol Barbie or Survivor Barbie Wasn't that GREAT!? *giggles* I luvs it! Ahhhh the joys of paranoid conspiracy ranting without any of the effort! Go, "Meg"! Well er seeya! Well, I’m back! *waits for applause* … … … … ANYWAY, today I am here with a very special treat for you loyal *insert random insect noise here* readers! Don’t you feel extra squishy? I’m here to “advertise” a wonderful product found ONLY (to my knowledge) at K-Mart (where I am a Cashier Slave of questionable Loyalty) Okay, here goes the commercial I have prepared: How would YOU like your four-year-old sibling/cousin/offspring/neighbor/pest to have ALL the fun and excitement of BIKING with none of those annoying little distractions, like being able to STOP at will? Well, you are in luck, Hapless Victim, because have WE the bike for YOU! Introducing the Tyke Byke (not actual product name) now with 100% less brakes! Wasn’t that fun AND entertaining? Seriously, though, I was bored and waiting for my shift to start (we can’t clock in early) and I happened to wonder into the bike section And I found a box with a picture of a happy little girl on it, wearing her helmet The box listed features of the bike, and (off to the side, in one of those happy little many-pointed stars where they usually write stuff like FREE!) was the words No Brakes! Like this was a GOOD thing! What the …? I thought brakes HELPED YOU! And to think, after all these years I have been wrong!? But seriously, can you IMAGINE the Marketing committee that designed this thing? I figure it was made of, say, Hitler, a cannibal, Satan and Mary Poppins (anyone else creeped out by her?) Here was their justifying equation (which I obtained through highly classified means, namely, a squirrel, a pack of walnuts and a mini-camera) Toddler + Tyke Byke + highway = hours of fun! I figure they WANTED small children to go careening into random objects Why else would they give ‘em no brakes? Anyway, I better go, I have this GREAT idea for a gun without a safety, and a very sensitive trigger Wow I"m back it's been an entire year and here I am again pointlessly ranting and raving Today's topic is Quaker Oats! You know Quaker Oats, right? Do a google search and find a picture, I dare you Chances are you'll find a creepy looking older white guy dressed all old fasioned if that's not bad enough: read on It turns out that Quaker Oats OWNS the Aunt Jemima syrup company Aunt Jemima is symbolized by a middle aged african american woman Now, let's think hrrm the time frame that the Quaker Oats guy is from plus owning a middle aged african american woman wait a minute! Are they implying that she's a slave!? What kind of public image are they trying to portray here!? The NERVE of that company! *shakes head* They really need to have a better publicist Ah well, there's your LTE rant of the day/week/month/year/insert time frame ehre Enjoy ^^ Heh, well, I’m once again back This time from a long hiatus involving College life, kiwi’s and cannibalism ^_^ But let’s ignore that for now, shall we? Today we have MUCH more important things to discuss ^_^ Like a certain warranty on a certain pair of a certain headphones at a certain store that a certain someone works at a certain summer after returning from a certain college Like most warranties, it guarantees the safety of the product for a limited time, and promises you fame, fortune, and your money back if it breaks during that time That, however, is where this warranties similarities to the norm cease Are you ready? *waits* How ‘bout now? *wait wait* STILL not ready? Bah, forget you, I’ll go on anyway *clears throat* I shall now paraphrase the warranty to you, in all it’s arcane glory and splendor This warranty shall not be in effect in the cases in which : 1 ) The product is purposefully damaged 2 ) The product is accidentally damaged 3 ) An act of God damages the product ……… *pause for effect* There you have it folks This beee-autiful warranty will NEVER be in effect It just won’t No matter what happens, the company issuing the warranty can just blame it on God I can just see just such a scenario playing out in my head…… *wavy thought lines scene transition indicating an imaginary scene* Ted: Yes, I’m calling to cash in on my 90-day money back warranty? Customer Service Agent: *snicker* Oh really? *polite, polite* Would you please describe the damage or malfunction your purchase is experiencing? Ted: …it just stopped working Customer Service Agent: *dripping with phony concern* Oh, gee, sir…but it seems that “just stopped working” falls under our “Act of God” clause, and our company cannot be held responsible for any vendettas that God may have against you Ted:…………… you’re telling me that because God hates me, my headphones stopped working? And that you won’t give me my money back? Customer Service Agent: *can’t hold it in any longer* *laughing until they gasp* Oh…God…that gets me every time…*gasp* *giggle* That’s just great… Sir, I suggest *wheeze* That you go to Church…*snicker* And see if you can’t convince God to fix it for you… *guffaw* Because…you’re waaaaaaaay more likely to get him to reimburse you then us! *hangs up* So, you see? I am extremely impressed by this quick thinking company If only I, too, could think of a way to so totally, and successfully scam my customers Oh Wait I do Every day, ……darn those Customer Service Plans! How stupid does a customer have to be to think that they should pay $20 now to insure their purchase of some stupid grill? If it breaks it would probably take 10 bucks to fix it *sigh* Why must K-mart compromise my honor? Ack! I spoke its name! *flee* Alright I'm Baaaa~ack! That's right Back from the dead like a fiery phoenix of nonsense and ranting, I return from months and months of not posting (and to make things even more interesting i won't mention anywhere else on the site that I made a new lte post!) So, today's topic is just on the concept of writing I go to a very math oriented college (i'm gonna be a programmer) so the people here just really suck at writing Completely! *happy* So for a small nominal $50* fee I shall teach you, the Hypothetical Reader, how to write grade A quality stories, guaranteed! ** (* $50 shall be payable in invisible, imaginary Official Flaming Chickens Lunar Colony's Dollars (approx $1 OFCLC is $1,337,000,000,00 in US dollars, circa 1957) ** not a guarantee) So are you ready? Let's start with a basic story even a kindergartner would write! Once upon a time there was a princess and a witch was making her sad but then a handsome prince came and killed the witch and made the princess happy really happy i mean really, really happy sometime three or four times a night and they lived happily ever after What a touching story, right? Let's see here, what basic story elements are we missing Why don't we check the formula for a successfull story, shall we? fuck you bitch motherfucker thing. Every Saturday, come rain or shine, a 6-seater Aero Commander aircraft flies out from Port Augusta on the South Australian coast. It heads for Boulia, a tiny township in the middle of Australia's dry center, carrying a maximum of three passengers and the mail that is such a critical link between the cities and the handful of people who live in this part of Australia's outback. Walter Glaser takes the trip and learns much about life in this remote part of the world. The little South Australian town of Port Augusta is like the old gray mare in the song "She Ain't What She Used To Be." Augusta was little more than a hamlet when it first came into prominence as the base for the exploration of Australia's vast, dry and empty Center. There, conditions were so hostile that only camels could survive the dry, treeless countryside and so some of these "ships of the desert", complete with Afghani drivers, were brought in from the Indian sub-continent. Burke and Wills, Central Australia's most famous exploration team, forayed into the yet-unknown inland until lack of food and water on their final expedition led to their death. Subsequently hardy pioneers conquered these adverse conditions to open up "the outback" and Australia's first telegraph link with Europe was established at Alice Springs. Augusta became the setting-off point for the camel trains that took supplies to Australia's "red heart." There were no sealed roads to cover these vast distances, and the dry, dusty 'bush' tracks along which the brave travelers had to bump their way had a habit of washing out every time the infrequent, but torrential rains came down in Central Australia. Then came the railway boom, and once the track was laid, the fastest, most reliable way to get from South Australia to Perth in the West, Alice Springs in the North or Sydney in the North-West was by rail. Augusta became the very hub of Australia's southern railway network, reaching the height of its importance early in the early l900's. Today Port Augusta, like most of the world's other railway towns, has declined in importance as trucks and planes usurped the railway monopoly. Now it is a spotless township of 15,000 people, many of whom make their living from servicing what remains of the rail links. Others work in the tourist industry or at the this town's large power station, a major electricity supplier to Adelaide, 300 km away. Now we are setting off from Port Augusta's small airport, flying in the 6-seater, twin-engined Aero Commander aircraft that has three of the seats piled high with mail and a little freight. In the next two days we will cover what is claimed to be the world's longest mail run, a distance of 2,600 km. It is early Summer and even at our 8.30 a.m. start the day is already hot, with the breeze at over 30 degrees Celcius. This part of Australia is prone to temperature extremes, consistently hot and dry in the summer months from November to April and almost freezing at night around August when it is winter in this part of the world. Within minutes of take-off we are flying parallel with the Flinders Ranges and heading into the sparsely populated Australian outback. Now Lake Torrens appears on the left. Central Australia was once completely covered by ocean, and the sand left behind when this retreated is loaded with salt. It doesn't rain much in these parts, but on the few occasions when it does, flash floods carry water, sand and salt down to this lake. The water sinks into the sand and disappears leaving the lake behind as a dry, shimmering salt-pan. On we fly into the distance, heading out over the Great Australian Emptiness. The vegetation grows sparser. We pass countless dry river beds, some lined with trees that doggedly survive from one rare rainfall to the next, shedding most of their foliage during the droughts to conserve moisture and then resprouting when life-giving water again becomes available. Below this hostile environment is the Great Australian Artesian Basin, a strata of underground sand that holds huge amounts of water. Experts say that this water is the result of rainfall in the New Guinea Highlands which has then sunk underground and has flowed subterraneously to come to rest in the Great Artesian Basin. In some areas this is too saline for crops or cattle, but in others the water is quite drinkable. By locating their homesteads near the trees lining the waterholes and the riverbeds that carry water during the wet season but dry up during summer, bore water can be pumped up to supplement or replace that from the very unreliable inland rivers. Amazingly, it is in this seemingly inhospitable terrain that free-range cattle not only survive but produce some of the world's finest quality beef. As we fly across this seemingly barren, uninhabited landscape, we see no houses to hint at human habitation, but it's there. Every now and then we fly over tracks of four-wheel-drive vehicles that seem to unwind into the distant haze like the erratic thoughts of a person demented. We are at an altitude of only around 3,000 feet when the pilot points ahead. There, right before us, is a bitumen landing strip big enough to take a Fokker F-28. Nearby, some neat look-alike clusters of houses all appear as if they have been cloned. This is Leigh Creek, where all 1,100 inhabitants work for the South Australian Electricity Commission, which operates the open-cut coal mine that is the township's reason for existence. Three times a week, coal trains heaped to the limit chug their way to Port Augusta laden with fuel for the power generators that create a large part of that town's employment. At Leigh Creek we re-fuel, loading up with more mail that will occupy most of the plane's interior. Our pilot and his assistant make sure that this is neatly tied down before we take off again to head for the individual cattle stations. As we wing even further north, and deeper into the Great Australian Emptiness, the till-now-rugged terrain of the Flinders Ranges undergoes a subtle change. It is even drier now. Lines of jagged hills denote geological faults that were pushed up by earthquakes aeons ago. But now there are also flat areas seemingly without any kind of vegetation, so much so that these might easily have been on the moon. Then the sparse vegetation appears again as we land at Moolawatanna, a relatively small cattle station covering 485 square miles. There is nothing else there. No shops, no schools and not even the great Australian essential -- the outback hotel and saloon ...known as 'pub' in Australia.... These homesteads must be the loneliest places on earth. The man sent out to pick up the mail from our aircraft doesn't like to be photographed, our pilot tells us. I am not surprised. The outback is full of strange characters -- recluses, illegal migrants, and men on the run from irate or demanding families. The person who lives and works in the Red Center is very often not able to handle the pressures of life in Australia's large coastal cities, but then the same can apply vice-versa. Now we are flying further inland still. Suddenly I notice some small steel structures randomly located in the desert below. They look like mechanical drinking ducks. Our pilot announces that we are coming in to land at the Moomba gas and oil field. Should be interesting! And so it is. Moomba is about as easy to get to as the oil-drilling platforms in the North Sea. The oil and gas deposits were discovered here after scientists assured Australia for many decades that there was absolutely no chance of finding either of these on the Australian mainland. Now the book is being re-written with the use of high-tech methods that include soundings from subterranean explosions and spectrographic satellites that can photograph and analyze the terrain from space, even recognizing, in some circumstances what minerals are hidden underground. The Moomba field is so prolific in natural gas that it is now taking care of the total requirements of Sydney and Adelaide, with the surplus being exported and some oil being produced as well. Four hundred men work here in the often-40 degree Celcius heat, laboring daily for 2 weeks and then enjoying two weeks rest and recreation in Adelaide. There are no women in this area, as the oil and gas consortium that operates this field considers conditions are too harsh for them. At the tiny air terminal we find what our pilot says is the least-used ladies toilet in Australia. Airport regulations say there has to be one, even in this female-free zone. From here we "station-hop", landing at cattle station after cattle station, dropping off mail and the occasional box of groceries or other deliveries, picking up outgoing mail and flying off to the next station. These stretch with substantial intervals along the line where after the rare rains, rivers run across the "dead center" before emptying into a series of inland lakes that evaporate when the dry season resumes. We are here at the beginning of "the wet" as Australians call the short rainy season in this area, and it rained six weeks ago. The land still looks like semi-desert, but with a green stubble. It can rain at any time of the year here, but it's November to March that this is most likely. However, it is quite unpredictable and in some years the area misses out on rain completely. Our pilot comments that we are about to land at Innamincka. This is yet another interesting station, settled in 1882 and situated on the banks of Coopers Creek. Explorers Burke and Wills passed east of this in their expedition of 1860 and died here near the famous "Dig" tree under which they had buried the notes of their expedition. Today the population has exploded to a full twenty-five people, most looking after the 8,000-square-mile Innamincka cattle station. There's one store, one pub, and not much else. Durham Downs and Arrabury follow and then we arrive at Birdsville, perhaps Australia's most famous outback "town." It boasts a population of 70 people when everybody is "in town" and the Birdsville pub is the social center for whites and Aboriginals alike. Everyone gets on well in this little town -- no evidence of any inter-racial tension or even segregation. Perhaps the reason is that everyone is doing well. There is no unemployment while cattle are getting good prices. Once a year Birdsville has the famous outback races, when people from every corner of Australia and overseas come in for this event. The race track is simply an oval shape marked out in the dry soil, yet horses are brought in from various parts -- mainly from South Australia and Queensland -- and an incredible crowd of 4,000 people descend on Birdsville for its one annual weekend of glory. With them come a supply of portable toilets, food stalls, and even souvenir sellers. Accommodation is in tents and sleeping bags alongside 4-wheel-drives and under the wings of private aircraft. Outback Australians seem to distrust drinking water so truckloads of beer arrive for this event. The thirst is summed up by a sign on the wall of the Birdsville Pub "Try our 7-course meal -- a six-pack of beer and a meat pie." We spend an hour at the pub to give the pilot a break ...although he, unluckily for him, has to restrict himself to lemonade and soda water..., and talking to the locals gives us a chance to learn something about what makes this part of the outback "tick." And we find that one has to "think big" when it comes to this sparsely populated part of Australia. Free-range cattle raising is the life-blood of Diamantina Shire ...formed in 1886... which, with an area of 95,000 sq.km., is the second-largest Shire in Queensland. To support this vast area there are 1,683 km. of Shire roads of which 1,676 km. are gravel or dirt track and 7 km. are bitumen. This Shire, which has a total population of 260 people, both Aboriginal and Caucasian, is made up of three "towns" -- Bedourie ...the administration center... with 60 people -- Birdsville with 100 people and Betoota, ...176 km. from Birdsville... where the population has dropped to one person who runs the Betoota Hotel and Store. Unemployment is virtually non-existent in this part of Australia, because it is only the jobs that keep people living here. There are many other fascinating aspects to Birdsville. It has a small thermal power station, using the energy from the very hot underground water. Water comes from underground bores, and reaches the surface at a steady temperature of 99 degrees Celcius, and is then piped to all houses at this temperature and used for heating where this is necessary. Although the area can have a Summer temperature consistently over 40 degrees Celcius, and frequently reaches 50 degrees Celcius, night-temperatures in Winter can be quite cold, though never freezing. The town is surrounded by 14 cattle stations some of which belong to the Kidman family, a clan that has the largest cattle holdings in this part of Australia. But before I could start to feel sorry for these outback inhabitants, I was told that last year the 14 local cattle stations had shipped out $55 million of cattle which, in spite of the drought, obtained premium prices because of their high standard. Talking to locals at the pub also revealed other interesting facets of Birdsville life. The Queensland/New South Wales state border is only 12 km. away and two brothers, both reputed millionaires, have their farms near to this. They have also had a double fence, with a few feet of "no-man's-land" in the middle, erected between their properties, the result of an ongoing vendetta, and have not spoken to each for years. There are, however, occasions when the brothers have to communicate, and when these arise one brother will call one of the drinkers over and ask him to pass the message on to the other brother. That way they overcome the communication problem, honor and the vendetta prevail -- and everyone in town knows what is going on between them. News in the bush travels fast incidentally, a process known as "getting it on the bush telegraph", though the solar-powered radio-telephones operated by Australian Telecom are usually the real channel by which the bush-telegraph operates. The pub has billiard tables and every imaginable kind of Birdsville curio. A section of the large wall is covered with wide-brimmed bushman's hats ...known in Australia as Akubras, after the largest manufacturer of these, and made famous world-wide by being worn by golfer Greg Norman and movie character Paul Hogan of "Crocodile Dundee" fame.... When the stockman's hats are old, tattered and due for replacement no-one in Birdsville throws these out. The ritual here is that a new hat is purchased and then the old one, with due ceremony, is presented to the Birdsville Bar for the collection. But strangers cannot donate their hats. There is a minimum qualifying period of 12 month's Shire residency before anyone can offer hats for the collection. Medical services are supplied by Australia's famous Flying Doctor Service, with two trained Nurses in residence at Birdsville to provide First Aid. There is also a primary school, currently consisting of one teacher and 16 children, but as these get older they may go off to boarding schools in either Brisbane, Adelaide, Warwick or Longreach. The alternative is a program called "School of the Air" -- an outback radio school which has proved a boon to those living in the remote parts of Australia's center. It's time to say goodbye to the drinkers at the Birdsville pub and reboard the aircraft. Soon we are stopping at other stations just long enough to touch-down and drop off our mailbags. Just as the sun is setting on the horizon, we land at Boulia, our northern-most stopping point. Like Birdsville, Boulia is on the very edge of the desert. But unlike well-to-do Birdsville, which relies on its wealthy cattle stations for employment, Boulia is a poor relative by comparison -- a town where the major employer is the local Shire Council. This gets grants from the Queensland and Federal Governments to build and maintain the road system in the area, in the process providing the major employment opportunities for its population of 260. Now this small town is our overnight stop, and staying at the Boulia pub gives us an insight into another aspect of outback life in this town. As in large, sparsely populated rural towns all over the world, the young, the adventurous and the capable tend to leave, heading for a new life in the big cities. Many of those that remain in Boulia work on the roads during the day, come home for an early dinner, and then head straight for the pub which is the hub of Boulia's social life. Serious drinking starts around 6.30pm, with Aboriginals on one side of the pub and whites on the other. "There is nothing else to do here except drink and talk" a local resident tells us. By about 8:30pm everyone has reached the end of their alcohol tolerance and the place gets pretty noisy. The next morning finds us exploring the little township of Boulia. It is spotlessly clean and very obviously a place of pride to its inhabitants. A sign explains that this is the last stop before heading into the great inland desert. Once passed Boulia, you are "on your own." And those who venture further are well advised to register their names with the local Police Station, advising the officer there of the destination and estimated traveling time. It is a time-honored tradition for the outback police to then "check out" that the travelers have arrived, and in the rare cases where this has not happened, to instigate a helicopter or light-aircraft search. To have a vehicle breakdown in the desert, run out of water and have no-one know that you're there can be a fatal experience. Fortunately the friendly local police will always be happy to assist the travelers. Yet a sojourn into the desert can be an exhilarating experience. The unpolluted air, the arid yet beautiful landscapes, the sense of space and the million brilliant stars one sees on a clear night, the amazing flora and fauna that somehow manages to survive in this harsh environment, and the interesting characters one meets are just some of the never-to-be-forgotten outback experiences. Mid-morning sees us back on the plane and heading South. On the way back, we land at other vast ranches similar to the ones we had called at on the way up. At each we touch down on the stations compacted-earth airstrip, drop off mail, chat for a minute or two, and move on. Again we stop at Birdsville. Many of the same drinkers are at the bar and greet us like long-lost friends. New faces are rare in the outback. We zig-zag to yet more stations until our mail compartment is empty and the nose of our plane is pointing towards Port Augusta as we make our return landing. Our pilot explains that Augusta Airways, who have the mailrun contract from the Australian Postal Service, need the revenue from the tourists who take this trip to survive. Most of the guests who take this trip are overseas visitors who want to see what life in Australia's outback is all about. But even for us who reside in Melbourne, a large international city of 3 million inhabitants, the "longest mail-run" outback experience has also been an eye-opener and one that has really given us a glimpse into the vastness that is Australia's interior.
